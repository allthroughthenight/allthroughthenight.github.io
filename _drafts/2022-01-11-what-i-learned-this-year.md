title: "What I Learned This Year"
---

# Introduction

Third year and third post, to follow up on [2019]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/01/20/what-i-learned-this-year.html) and [2020]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/01/11/what-i-learned-this-year.html).
This year I restricted my reddit and hacker news access, nothing crazy, just a simple add-on. I could still check it the site, but definetly wanted to break the 'fridge check' kind of reflex.
I think this might be the smallest post so far, but I think it'll be less about link collecting, and I'll have less to clean up for this post.
also write this to my self every year https://www.futureme.org/

[new codebase, who dis? (How to Join a Team and Learn a Codebase)](https://www.samueltaylor.org/articles/how-to-learn-a-codebase.html):
1. Locate the portion of code most relevant to the immediate task at hand.
2. Understand that code enough to form a hypothesis about the change you need to make.
3. Make that change and test your hypothesis. Sometimes the best way will be to click around in the UI or run a particular script. Sometimes the easiest path is to write a test that describes the behavior you're after.
4. If your hypothesis was incorrect, return to step 2. Understand why that change didn't do what you thought it would, and develop a new hypothesis.
5. Once you have working code, improve its quality. Write a test (or a few) that document the changes in behavior you made. Refactor your code for clarity and style.

[on: Maximizing Developer Effectiveness](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25800830):
> Here I am, a productive developer eager to deliver maximum value to my customers and apply my innovation to company goals.
> Open up JIRA and pick up a unit of work to produce today -- gotta stay faithful to those story points!
> Somehow, a magic team of spherical devops in a vacuum created an environment where things are just green, predictable, and are never broken.
> Another theoretical team of angels from a parallel universe has materialized into this one, updated all the docs, and beamed back into their universe of productivity and effectiveness.
> Unit of work defined, I then proceed to produce it for a few hours completely uninterrupted, since if another human being were to make contact, I'd simply explode and format my hard drive, losing all my productivity.
> It's break time -- I ingest 2 story points of coffee and join a game of table tennis. The ball bounces back and forth without ever touching the ground. My movements are productive, and value-adding, just like my partner's.
> Back to producing units of work, only half a story point left (sike! no such thing as half a story point, and no such thing as "left", as it's a measure of effort, not time. Almost got you there!).
> Git push! Automatic CI gains consciousness and validates that my work unit has no chance of causing a user to break our software. It gives me a thumbs up and discards its human shell to fade back into the ones and zeros. A QA engineer cries out in the distance.
> A metric of my productivity is logged to the OKR database.
> Nothing breaks, and nothing unexpected happens, as the universe is completely predictable.
