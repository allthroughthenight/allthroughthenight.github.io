# Introduction

blog: how i changed my planning, from todo list to calendar to gdrive, but back to list and less "static" doc (gdrive, ~files), easier to just do nothing since important stuff will come up on their own, https://developertea.com/episodes/5d787fd2-735c-4cdb-bd93-bdb84062f3a8 actaully if anything i'm back to cramming my calendar, trying to spread everything out (gdoc, drafts here, etc) made me miss these trivial things, when i should just plan and knock them out ezpz, also currently using keep a bit more? so it's at the front and available on pc and mobile, less to try to sync with drive, and not hidden in some indiana jones archive text file, sketch on a note, then make actionable on calendar
