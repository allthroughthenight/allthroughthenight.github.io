title: "What I Enjoyed This Year"
---

Looking back at my media consumption over the past few years I saw a few issues:
* [What I Read This Year: 2019]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/01/02/what-i-read-this-year.html): Most of the books I read using [my method]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/10/01/how-i-read.html), which is great for getting through a lot, but in retrospect it's left me with a lack of [deep understanding in the long run.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29621642)
* [What I Played This Year: 2020]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/01/02/what-i-played-this-year.html): Less about games I really enjoyed, and more about finishing what I started (same for [2021]({{site.baseurl}}/2022/01/02/what-i-played-this-year.html)). And I think took away from my desire to read as much in [2021]({{site.baseurl}}/2022/01/01/what-i-read-this-year.html).

Reading (another) [hn post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29755155) made me realize I'm not taking advantage of my youth. Not saying I should min-max my lifestyle, but forcing myself to get through games I'm apathetic about, or speeding through audiobooks and summaries since I don't want to make the time to read them, when I could just go out and do stuff that I might not be able to 5 or more years from now. 

This is contradictory to how I want to [enjoy my free time]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/06/01/purposeful-play.html) but I'm still trying to find a balance. Going forward I'd like to merge my Reading and Gaming posts into this general Enjoyment post. So to better explain the overall intent of this post, I'd like to hold myself accountable for enjoying my free time properly. And since this is more generic, I've also included other media like Movies and Shows, and other activities that are constant but don't need their own posts like [Gunpla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam_model) and [Disc golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_golf).

# Books

After reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/re7hnb/share_ye_tale_with_us/) reddit post, and that my reading from 2021 turned me off to novels a bit, I decided to just do short stories. That way they can be enjoyed in one sitting and I don't have to feel like I'm committing to an epic saga.

* TBD

# Games

I got an Oculus Quest 2 for Christmas and I've been having a blast once I got a link cable to play games from my PC. I also played a few other games that I've been wanting to but have been putting off.

* Elite Dangerous: A Space Sim Lite, but hard to stay busy after a few hours unless you make your own goals
* Halo Infinite: They should've had Master Cheif in an open world game sooner
* Ion Fury: A boomer-shooter built with a modified version of the [Build game engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_(game_engine)) 
* Star Wars Jedi - Fallen Order:
