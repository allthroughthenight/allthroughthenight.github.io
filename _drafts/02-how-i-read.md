How to Talk About Books You Haven't Read

I like going through suggested books and readings lists on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), and they're so popular that someone made a [program to make a definifitive list](https://towardsdatascience.com/hacker-news-book-suggestions-64b88099947).
But unless you're an avid reader, it can be a bit of a chore. And as for me, most books have their main poitns in the chapter titles, then they just spend the body of the chapter supporting them.

When I was down a YouTube rabbit hole on Tai Lopez (the ["Here in my garage"](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/here-in-my-garage) guy) (I have nothing anything against him, just curious how he became famous) some videoes criticized his "I read a book a day" claim. And that he just reads summaries to get the main points, then re-reads often enough to internalize the concepts so they're in the front of his mind.
It's not unheard of to read a book a day, but most knowledge-based and self-improvement books can be a bit dense, and won't have an enjoyable narrative like a non-fiction book.
But I did like the idea of summaries, and I already have a [tool](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) that I used regularly to help me with learning via repetition.

So I've combined the two and 1) find the summary of a book I want to read then 2) make Anki flashcards of it  and 3) go through them normally with the rest of them.

Some reading purist might think it blasphemous to not read a book in it's entirety, or that by not sitting and focusing on reading I'm reducing my ability to focus. The former is just ["No True Scotsman"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman), though the later does have merit. But for me, my concern is getting the text into my noggin, and making sure it sticks, and what I do works for me.
