title: What I've Learned in 2020
---

# Introduction

This is a follow-up to my [previous post](https://ramblevalley.wordpress.com/2020/01/20/what-ive-learned-so-far/), which I hope I can keep going as a regular series. </p>
But part-way into this year, I was wondering how this post was almost as long as the previous one, even though it was covering a lot less time.</p>
Going through it, I noticed that I'd been fixating on articles and posts that'd bemoan the strife from  working in tech. But I want to keep the tone of this positive, so I removed a bunch of that stuff, along with making sure everything is focused more squarely on tech, and avoiding anything <em>too</em> technical, so it can be a light read no matter the skill level.</p>

# Articles
[Austin Amazon KFAUWI device randomly appeared under Network Device](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/amazon-kfauwi-appeared-network-device):
  The same motherboard maker for Amazon Fires and Kindles uses Linux source code for automatic device discovery. So any device running the same code will cause Windows to detect it as an Amazon Fire.

[Career advice for people with bad luck](https://chiefofstuff.substack.com/p/career-advice-for-people-with-bad):
  It’s okay to go for the safe job, it’s also okay to take risks. Overall, it all tends to work out, on average, eventually. And you’ll regret it either way.

[Do-nothing scripting: the key to gradual automation](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2019/07/15/do-nothing-scripting-the-key-to-gradual-automation/): Instead of trying to automate everything at once, write down what you'd do by hand first, then automate each step in the process.


[Docker for Windows won't run if you have the Razer Synapse driver management tool running](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1229641258370355200.html): Both applications lock the wrong system-wide global check to ensure that only one instance of an application runs, but then neither of them can run at the same time.

[Fire drill](https://medium.com/@mshmsh5000/fire-drills-for-software-teams-164ba48b10b1): In the same way you plan for a fire (or other disaster) by having drills, by doing the same for a software team, you can see how well they'll react and how your plan would work.

[Is non-deterministic the same as random?](https://www.quora.com/Is-non-deterministic-the-same-as-random): 
* **random**: a bunch of stuff happens that doesn't make sense
* **non-deterministic**: something happens but there's no obvious reason as to why
* **deterministic**: we know what happens, and how to make it happen. Random events can sometimes be non-deterministic, but non-deterministic does not mean random.

[List of 2020 Leap Day Bugs](https://codeofmatt.com/list-of-2020-leap-day-bugs): A collection of various software bugs due to the extra day this year.

[Programming Trick Question](https://qntm.org/trick): Answers to three common programming interview questions.

[The EARN IT Act: How to Ban End-to-End Encryption Without Actually Banning It]("https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/01/earn-it-act-how-ban-end-end-encryption-without-actually-banning-it"): How to Ban End-to-End Encryption Without Actually Banning It: Tell companies that in order to keep their immunity offered in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (that platform providers aren't liable for their users), they must comply with 'best practices' to prevent the exploitation of minors. These best practices will be outlined mostly by Law Enforcement Agencies, and partly by tech consultants.
* [230, or not 230? That is the EARN IT question](https://signal.org/blog/earn-it/")
* [EARN IT is a direct attack on end-to-end encryption](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/")
* [Senator Blumenthal Is Super Mad That Zoom Isn't Actually Offering The End To End Encryption His Law Will Outlaw](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200401/16571344217/senator-blumenthal-is-super-mad-that-zoom-isnt-actually-offering-end-to-end-encryption-his-law-will-outlaw.shtml")
* [The EARN IT Act Violates the Constitution](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/earn-it-act-violates-constitution")

[The History of the URL](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-history-of-the-url/): Partly about how URLs came to be, along with the Internet as a whole.

[The Infinite Loop That Wasn't: A Holy Grail Bug Story]("https://mgba.io/2020/01/25/infinite-loop-holy-grail/"): The solution to a bug for a specific Hello Kitty game for a GameBoy Advanced emulator that took part of three years to understand and fix.

[The 'Race To 5G' Is A Giant Pile Of Lobbyist Nonsense]("https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200116/08134343743/race-to-5g-is-giant-pile-lobbyist-nonsense.shtml"): TelCo's realize that mobile device sales are down, and want a way to hype upgrades, while also presenting an 'Us vs China' mentality to secure free public government funding for private corporate infrastructure upgrades. Also considering that 3G coverage is still spotty in rural areas, and current 5G coverage maps aren't accurate, overall it's not the new hotness as it's being made out to be.

[Things I Believe About Software Engineering](https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/engineering-beliefs") *(excerpts)*:
* Being aligned with teammates on what you're building is more important than building the right thing.
* Thinking about things is a massively valuable and underutilized skill. Most people are trained to not apply this skill.
* How kind your teammates are has a larger impact on your effectiveness than the programming language you use.
* The amount of sleep that you get has a larger impact on your effectiveness than the programming language you use.

[The Computer Scientist Who Can’t Stop Telling Stories](https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientist-donald-knuth-cant-stop-telling-stories-20200416/)
> "I write an average of five new programs every week. Poets have to write poems. I have to write computer programs."
>
> \- Donald Knuth

[Three weeks ago, I ordered a box of boxes from @PkgWholesalers, via @amazonca](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225834920611848192.html): Since other sellers on amazon buy their boxes from the same seller, they ended up getting boxes that were full with a product.

[Toil](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/): Work that is manual, repetitive, automatable, reactive, or doesn't provide enduring value. In short, if the work it doesn't have a permanent improvement to a system when it's complete, then it should be considered toil.

[Trunk-based Development vs. Git Flow](https://www.toptal.com/software/trunk-based-development-git-flow): A versioning process other than the ubiquitous GitFlow-esque method.

[Up or Out: Solving the IT Turnover Crisis](http://thedailywtf.com/articles/Up-or-Out-Solving-the-IT-Turnover-Crisis): a.k.a. [The Dead Sea Effect](http://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/11/the-wetware-crisis-the-dead-sea-effect/). No matter what, top talent will leave an organization, while the under qualified will stay since they can't move on. Instead of instead of struggling to retain top talent, embrace the turn-over and learn to train top talent. Hire for attitude, train for aptitude.

[What To Do When You Reach Number 1 On Hacker News](https://www.jarednelsen.dev/posts/what-to-do-when-you-reach-number-1-on-hacker-news): A follow up to [The Horrifically Dystopian World of Software Engineering Interviews](https://www.jarednelsen.dev/posts/The-horrifically-dystopian-world-of-software-engineering-interviews) and the overall state of technical interviews.

[Your statement is 100% correct but misses the entire point](http://nibblestew.blogspot.com/2020/04/your-statement-is-100-correct-but.html?m=1): Though most "Well, Actually..." comments, thought factually correct, will miss often the context of a problem.

# Books

## AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order

* Training deep learning models requires more of a brute force method than innovation; well suited to China's supposedly higher quantity but lower quality of software engineer compared to the US
* China has lax data privacy and protection regulations so they can collect more data and use it more freely
* Since the Chinese tech startup culture is more intense and with less IP protections, only strong business, not the best ideas, survive
* Though the West has a head-start, Government backing of AI projects in China make it highly appealing and in a position to outpace the rest of the world

## Coders at Work (TBD/WIP)

* https://vlkan.com/blog/post/2016/10/04/coders-at-work/
* https://jonwood.co/blog/2016/12/12/book-review-coders-at-work
* https://oleb.net/blog/2010/02/book-review-coders-at-work/

## Code Complete

* Have plan before starting work. If requirements are constantly changing, efforts are wasted having to constantly context shift and multi-task
* Focus on standards and consistency. By knowing what'll happen, and having expectations for what should be done in routine scenarios, you can save your energy for more challenge problems
* Code is read more than it's written. By making it clear and concise, you can spend more time solving harder problems
* Be firm, but flexible. Being too rigid can hamper creativity, hinder inquisitiveness, and hinder creative or new ideas
* Be ego-less, accept that you don't (and probably) won't know everything and focus on solving problems 

## Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World

* Deep Work: "Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate"
* Shallow Work: "Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate"
* The Deep Work Hypothesis: "The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive"
* Busyness as Proxy for Productivity: "In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner"
* When you work, work hard. When you’re done, be done: "Decades of work from multiple different subfields within psychology all point toward the conclusion, that regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work. When you work, work hard. When you’re done, be done"
* The Four Rules of Deep Work
  1. Work Deeply - Make rules, rituals, and routines to make it easier and more automatic to get into deep work
  2. Embrace Boredom - You need to think about how you concentrate outside of work as well, so be comfortable with not being stimulated (email inbox, smartphone notifications) all the time
  3. Quit Social Media - The quintessential example of shallow living. 
  4. Drain the Shallows - Reduce the effect of low-values tasks like replying emails, making phone calls, and attending meetings by batching them together or at predetermined times


## Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence

* Prediction: Machines are good at consistency when compared to humans, and even marginal improvements are substantial since they can be replicated over time
* Decision Making: Ideally, the more data and input you have, the better a decision you'll make. This is true for machines, but not for humans since we'll be overwhelmed or take to long. But humans are good at intuition, which machines (at this time) lack
* Tools: Automation won't take over entire jobs overnight, but instead different aspects of a task
* Strategy: For a business to see a good RoI on AI, it has to be prepared for it. If current prediction and forecasting methods are outdated, than AI solutions will clash with the status quo
* Society: Society isn't ready for the inequality that will arise from broad AI adoption. While some will reap massive benefits, others will suffer due to no fault of their own

## Test-Driven Development By Example

* Test-Driven Development Patterns: Have a core 'TODO' list of what you know you'll have to test, tests should run independent of each other, and test data should make it obvious what the use case is
* Red Bar Patterns: Tests help you better understand the system with what they test with their coverage, and how they test with their implementation
* Testing Patterns: Break down larger tests into smallr ones, use mock objects to cover corner cases, and don't be afraid to stop when a test isn't working. Then you'll know where to pick up on later
* Green Bar Patterns: Write the simplest code to pass a test. It'll provide a psychological boost, and will show where more difficult parts are
* Refactoring: Remove duplication, break up large functions, separate refactoring from changes, and automate as much as possible

## The Big Nine</h4>

* G-MAFIA: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, IBM, Apple
* BAT: Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent
* In the West, technology is used for a commercial advantage first, and the societal impacts are considered secondary
* But AI advancements won't happen in a vacuum, so they'll have to be adaptable to stay relevant
* *In China, technology is used for control and order, which is backed and supported by the government. And they're protected from outside competition and oversight
* In both scenarios, the long term effects of decisions made now aren't considered. The next few decade will be a critical time for shaping the idea of how to control AI for the betterment or eventual destruction of humanity

## The DevOps Handbook
* The Three ways
  * Enable fast left to right flow of work from Ideation to Customer by making work visible and reducing batch sizes (WIP)
  * Enable fast and constant flow of feedback from left to right at all by seeing problems as they occur
  * Create culture of high-trust that supports a dynamic, disciplined and scientific approach to experimentation and risk taking

</li>
<li>Ron Westrum's three types of cultures
<ul>
<li><strong>Pathological </strong>- Large amounts of fear and threat. People hoard information, withhold it, distort it for their own good. Failure is hidden.</li>
<li><strong>Bureaucratic</strong> - Many rules and processes, so departments can hold on to their “turf”. Failure is judged.</li>
<li><strong>Generative</strong> - Actively seeking and sharing of information to improve the organization. Responsibilities are shared, and failure results in reflection and a desire for understanding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Possible Constraints
<ul>
<li><strong>Code deployment</strong>: Automated deployments are faster than what people can do, and removes human error</li>
<li><strong>Test setup and run:</strong> Automate tests so you can do deployments safely</li>
<li><strong>Overly tight architecture:</strong> Loosely couple components, so  changes are safer, testing is easier, and productivity is increased</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How Resources are Wasted
<ul>
<li><strong>Partially done work: </strong>Loses value as time passes</li>
<li><strong>Extra features:</strong> Add complexity and effort to testing and overall understanding</li>
<li><strong>Task switching: </strong>Time and effort lost context switching</li>
<li><strong>Waiting: </strong>Testing, clarification, or deployments all slow down feedback loops</li>
<li><strong>Hand-offs:</strong> Usually need additional communication to resolve ambiguities</li>
<li><strong>Manual Processes: </strong>Slows down feedback loops and introduces human error</li>
<li><strong>Heroics:</strong> Staying late and working odd hours affects an organization's morale</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h4>The Managers Path</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>You need to demonstrate performing at the next level, before being promoted to the next level</li>
<li>Have regular 1-on-1's to allow regular, private communications about expectations and how they are or aren't being met</li>
<li>When providing feedback, by starting with what's positive, others will be more perceptive on how to improve</li>
<li>Those to be promoted to manager shouldn't be judged on their individual contributions, since the next level is about how they can help other achieve</li>
<li>Leaders should focus on making a fertile environment so their team can do great work</li>
<li>Delegate to lighten your load, and to show that you can trust your team with important tasks</li>
<li>With all the time you invest in finding a new hire, you should spend even more time mentoring them, and clearly communicate what it takes to succeed</li>
<li>Shield your team from as much as possible so they concentrate on their work. But don't shelter them, they need to know the context of what's going on</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>The Phoenix Project</strong></h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve your laterals
<ul>
<li><strong>Deployment (left-to-right):</strong> Business -&gt; Development -&gt; Operations -&gt; Customer. This can be done by reducing or removing barriers between each, and limiting the work in progress.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback (right-to-left):</strong> Make a faster and tighter feedback loop so you can better adjust, adapt, and overcome quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Know the 4 Categories of Work
<ul>
<li><strong>Planned Work:</strong> New features and enhancements</li>
<li><strong>Internal Projects:</strong> Tooling improvements, production migrations, mostly pertinent to the team but transparent to most everyone else</li>
<li><strong>Changes:</strong> Something driven by feedback that becomes planned work, like a feature change or request</li>
<li>Unplanned Work: A bug escalation or other emergency/outage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lastly, unless their is a failure nothing will change. Why do something different if everything fine?</li>

## The Pragmatic Programmer
* Don't make excuses and or look to the outside when aiming blame, take ownership and resolve the issue. Sign your work and take pride in it.
* Know the [Broken Window Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory), so as to avoid normalizing bad quality, and clean as you go to improve the quality of a product
* Be a catalyst for change through example, instead of standing on high and pointing out how others are wrong
* Technical knowledge has an expiration date, continually invest in yourself and make learning a habit
* In the same way a carpenter works with wood, a SWE works with text. Know your tools, maintain them and your skills. Adopt tools that help you, and stop using those that don't.

## Working Effectively with Legacy Code
* The initial paradox: To better understand code, you need to test it. But legacy code wasn't written to be tested. 
* To make the code more testable it needs to be decoupled, but decoupling can break functionality.
* Always refactor before rewriting. Rewriting can be costly, not operate the same as the original system, and leave out unknown functionality.
* When refactoring 1) Test before and after to ensure it operates the same and 2) automate as much as possible with linters and static analysis tools.
* If a rewrite is required, don't try to develop a new system in parallel with maintaining the old system. Instead, slowly replace parts of the old system so the transition is transparent.
* Documentation was written for a reason, and your first line source of information. Read what's available and keep it up to date as changes are introduced.
* You don't have control of what's already been done with the legacy system, so have a standard for new code to ensure quality moving forward.
