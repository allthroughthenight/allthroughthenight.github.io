Last year I virtually attended [GitHub Universer 2024](https://www.githubuniverse.com). The biggest thing that stood out to me was how much they were pushing Copilot and VS Codes AI integrations twoards their goal of [1 billions developers](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/road-1-billion-developers-demetris-cheatham-lh1ff/). The genie is out of the bottle, and to be a professional engineer in the future, you not only need to know how to use, but also how to leverage AI technology.

Current LLMs are resource heavy, so paying for them as a service can get pricey. Instead you can invest on your own machine and run them locally. This saves you money in the long run (even when compared with electrical costs) and ensures privacy since everything stays on your own machine.
