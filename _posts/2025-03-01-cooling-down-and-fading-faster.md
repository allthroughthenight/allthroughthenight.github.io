Google's headquarters were once a beacon of innovation and experimentation, a place where bright ideas and bold thinking came together to create something truly revolutionary. Today, they feel like a museum piece – a relic of a time when technology was still young and full of promise.

Remember when Apple's iPhone was the epitome of cool? When having one made you feel like you were part of an exclusive club? Those days are long gone. Today, it's just another commodity, a mere accessory to our constant connectivity.

HN discussion threads are filled with posts lamenting the loss of innovation and creativity in the industry. We're left with a glut of homogenized products and services that prioritize speed over substance. The thrill is gone, replaced by the humdrum of updates and bug fixes.

The cool factor has faded, replaced by a dull grey of mediocrity.
