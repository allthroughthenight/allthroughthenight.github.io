title: "More Networking Boards"
---

Looking back at my media consumption over the past few years I saw a few issues:

My previous [networking board]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/03/21/networking-board.html) was pretty good. It was space efficient, had a [pi-hole]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/01/31/ad-blocking.html) for ad-blocking, and overall did what it needed to. When I moved to a new place, I had more space to cover, and had to think of a new way to get connectivity everywhere.

When I first made my networking board, I bought the Linksys WRT1900AC with the intent to install [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) from the start. I think I was alwasy afraid of the ROM flashing process and bricking the router. Even though it's as simple as downloading the ROM and having the router update, it still put me off. Thinking back, I'm not sure why it took me more than two years to do it, but after some internet issues I finally did.

When I looked flashing and set-up [instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVjIOzErKcc), they were exactly what I thought they'd be. If anything maybe a litter easier? It only took me around 15 minutes to flash the router, and another 30 minutes playing with settings. Once I was done connectivity was back, but I was still having issues connecting to the internet. 

The good things about OpenWRT is that it has a lot of setting and features for power users. The bad thing about OpenWRT is that it has a lot of settings and features for power users.
