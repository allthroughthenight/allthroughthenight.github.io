I'm not one to "drink the Kool-Aid" and think working in tech is something special. It's just a job to pay the bills. But there is a lot of movies out there that can make me a bit proud working in the same field that others find inspiring. So when ever I'm feeling a bit jaded these are my go to's to get energized.
