Like my [previous job search post](https://allthroughthenight.github.io/2021/03/01/my-interviewing-success.html), I kept track of my job search.

A major change from last time was to 1) apply to positions directly 2) work with recruiters and 3) get referalls. After HR screens you'll go through a few technical rounds, so I combined them (coding challenge, technical screen, on-site) regardless of the format.

I entered the tech industry before the pandemic and it was, without a doubt, the coolest place to work. Massages, free food, pool tables, along with great compensation packages. When the pandemic started, hiring increased since work from home increase company talent pools from their local area to the entire world. Workers saw that with hiring increasing they could move companies too. As the pandemic ended and balance sheets were checked, companies realized they overhired and started reducing headcount. As a final push, many mandated return to office policies to force more resignations. With interest rate lowering and AI tooling making work easier, some hiring has resumed. But experts that tech hiring likely won't return to pre-pandemic levels within our lifetime.

As a mid career professional, my interviews were spent less on technical abilities and more on technical stories and accomplishments. The understanding is that since I've worked in the industry for a while, technical adptitude is expected. But if you're planning to move into a more senior position, then you need to show your ability to help those around you.

There's also been a lot of talk and usage of AI tools to make applying and screening candidates easier. This has lead to an arms race of AI detections and prompt injection resumes. Which reminded me of this hn quote from a [past post of mine][2021]({{site.baseurl}}/2022/01/01/what-i-learned-this-year.html).

[on: The computers rejecting job applications](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26065594):
> The next logical step would be to train an adversarial AI against the hiring AI. You'd have the system generate your resume and application to maximize your chances. Then the hiring AI would need to be re-trained to account for this. And so on.
> In the far future, this feedback loop creates an economy where every job application is total gibberish. No human can possibly explain why their resume is a recipe for carne asada, an excerpt from Moby Dick, and a bunch of windings. But supposedly it's predicted to increase final offer salary by 13.54%, so nobody questions it. Anybody who still writes out their resume by hand is considered a luddite weirdo, and definitely not someone you'd want to have join your company.
