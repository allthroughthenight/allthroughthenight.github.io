As a casuale [homelabber](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab), I've always had the dream of 'maxing out'. Daydreaming about my own personal closed server rack, full of servers doing my bidding in a garage or basement. With a bespoke-built cooling solution that was power efficient but whisper quiet. The clients on my LAN would enjoy trasparent ad-blocking, and would stream locally stored HD media with blisteringly fast inter-connectivity from a multi terabyte NAS with [SFP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_form-factor_pluggable_transceiver) interfaces and switches. And to feed the network, I would have a fiber optic connection from my ISP, with no less than a gigabit connection. That, is the end game.

But having lived life a bit, I've realized that simpler is usually better (and cheaper). But I do like having control over my domain, and saving a bit a money. So instead of renting my [SOHO](https://www.lifewire.com/soho-routers-and-networks-explained-3971344) router from my ISP, I'd set up my own.

I started by looking for compatible devices, and set a budget based on average pricing. Then when my budget was ready, I started working on the [networking board](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=home+network+board&amp;ia=images&amp;iax=images). I was originally inspired by the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saD_SFOYCWk) done by Linus Tech Tips. It overall resonated with me since  1) have a corner of networking stuff that's piled up a needed to be organized and 2) I'm a renter so I can't drill holes.

I don't think the cost savings alone are worth it, but I like having control of my devices, so I don't have to worry about a weird box my ISP forces me to use, but I still have to pay for.

My next goal is to flash my Linksys WRT with [openWRT](https://openwrt.org), but I've only had it for a few months, so I'd like to enjoy everything working for a bit before I risk bricking it. And I didn't bother with cable management either since I know I'll change everything in a few months. But instead I focused on securing everything simply so that it'd be easy to adjust later.
