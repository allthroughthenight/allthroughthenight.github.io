The ergonomics saga continues ([part 1]({{site.baseurl}}/2025/05/01/ergonomics-part-2.html), [part 2]({{site.baseurl}}/2025/05/01/ergonomics-part-2.html)). I'm still using tried and tru Ikea Karlby counter top on Alex drawers, but I invested in a dedictated latop arm, and KVM for my webcam and periferals. With WFH being the norm, having a good remote presence is essential, and a good microphone and webcam are an easy way to elevate yourself.
