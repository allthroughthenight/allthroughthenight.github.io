title: "My Interviewing Success"

# Introduction

It's been a while since I've done an interview blitz, but I've kept a some what meticulous record of my past success and failures. I initially planned on interviewing more, then when I got the job I have now I stopped and focused on the new position. 

In true [r/cscareerquestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/) fashion, I made a [sankey diagram](http://sankeymatic.com/build/) to visualize how everything went.

For the summer between my senior semesters in college I was trying hard to get an internship anywhere to have some experience before I graduated in the fall.

My job search out of college was pretty rough, but I was glad when I landed the position that I did after working with a recruiter, and set my trajectory upwards and kick started my career.

# 2020 New Job

The position that started me off wasn't that great once I got settled, so I started shopping around and ended up landing a position thanks to a referral from a friends

# Overall

Considering the two major position I got were from referrals, my best advice would be to stay in touch with your contacts and network. You never know when it'll pay off.
