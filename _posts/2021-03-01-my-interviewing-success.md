title: "My Interviewing Success"
---

I have a few past posts ([1](https://allthroughthenight.github.io/2018/04/11/jump-start.html), [2](https://allthroughthenight.github.io/2018/05/03/virtually-interviewed.html), [3](https://allthroughthenight.github.io/2020/07/11/a-good-interview.html)) about my interview experiences, so recently I sat down and tried to remember my overall success and failures to show that it's not uncommon to get rejected. And in true [r/cscareerquestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/) fashion, I made a [sankey diagram](http://sankeymatic.com/build/) to visualize how everything went.

# 2017 Internship

For my senior summer in college, I tried for an internship anywhere to have some experience before I graduated in the Fall. I didn't know how competitive it was and I should've applied to more. I was past the half-way point with a [three-letter agency](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Three-letter%20Agencies), but instead I went with an offer I got from NASA at Johnson Space Center.

# 2018 New Grad

Looking for my first job as a new grad was rough. Luckily I was able to get a Software Engineer position by working with a recruiter.

# 2020 New Job

My first position was a learning experience, but for the wrong reasons. When I started shopping on my own I didn't have much success, then a friend reached out, refereed me, and I was able to move to a better position and company.

# Overall

Since the two major job I landed were from referrals, my best advice would is stay in touch with your contacts and tap your network when needed.
