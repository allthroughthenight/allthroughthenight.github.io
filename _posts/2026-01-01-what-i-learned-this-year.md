title: "What I Learned This Year - 2025"
---

# Introduction

2024 was a tough year for me. Continuing my layoff from the year before, I put a lot of pressure on myself to find a new job. It's discouraging to try your best and still fail. On the plus side with all the extra time I had, I was able to think about to do what I wanted to do, and not just what I needed to do. So my "What I Leanred This Year" post is back in top form with all the fun and interesting reads I found this past year.

[on: Chat is a bad UI pattern for development tools](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42936346): This hn comment is similar to how I use LLMs for coding.

Software development topics I've changed my mind on: [The article](https://chriskiehl.com/article/thoughts-after-10-years) and [hn comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42946281) provide contrast each other about what it means to take development seriously as a career, but to also not let it make you caustic because it's a job that's a means to an end to just pay the bills.
