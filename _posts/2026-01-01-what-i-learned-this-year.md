title: "What I Learned This Year - 2025"
---

# Introduction

2025 was a nice turn around. I started a new role, had some personal wins, and overall got better perspective on where I am and where I want to be. I've also been staying in the loop more with tech, and collected some article this past year.

# Articles

[Add F*cking to Your Google Searches to Neutralize AI Summaries](https://gizmodo.com/add-fcking-to-your-google-searches-to-neutralize-ai-summaries-2000557710): [hn](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42892191) also recommends using a negation flag "-fucking" to neutralize the AI response, but also avoid vulgar results

[on: Chat is a bad UI pattern for development tools](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42936346): This hn comment is similar to how I use LLMs for coding.

[WikiTol](https://wikitok.vercel.app/): Doom scroll random Wikipedia articles.
