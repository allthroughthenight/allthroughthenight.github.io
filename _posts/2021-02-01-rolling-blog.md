I've been going back and editing past posts. Not to rewrite history, but they read so terribly that they're almost useless. There's a point that you should keep your past work as-is to see how you've changed. But I also want to be able to go back and reference things, and if I can't understand what I wrote then it defeats that purpose for me. I don't have large readership, so editing past posts for most grammatical and spelling errors shouldn't upset anyone.

Don't worry if new posts don't seem complete. Github Pages allows you to have posts publish on future dates. I'd hope they'd be ready when the dates arrive, but I'd rather have them be published in rough draft state so I don't have up backlog.
