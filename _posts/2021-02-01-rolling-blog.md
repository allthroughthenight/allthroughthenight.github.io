I've been going back and editing past posts. I'm not trying to rewrite history, but they read so terribly that they're almost useless. There's a point to be made that you should keep your past work as-is to see how you've changed. But I also want to be able to go back and reference things, and if I can't understand what I wrote then it defeats that point for me. It's safe to assume that I have no readership, so I think editing past posts for most grammatical and spelling errors is fine. 

With how Jekyll and Github Pages is set up, I can set posts for future dates, but they won't be published until the date arrives. I'd hope they'd be ready for their scheduled dates, but I'd rather have them be published in rough draft state to prevent me from having up a backlog. So don't worry if newer posts aren't complete.
