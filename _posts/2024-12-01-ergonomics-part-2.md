title: "Ergonomics Part 2"

Continuing my previous [ergonomics post]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/11/01/ergonomics.html), we can take a look at my latest set-up. The biggest change was going from a sit-stand desk to a classic Ikea Alex + Countertop desk. The only things I even did standing at the desk were eating lunch and watch YouTube, so it just became novelty to stand it up. I also retired the split keyboard for a ten-keyless model. The split-keyboard did help with some minor RSI pain, but I had  the biggest improvments by just being more active. One day I might go [all in on ergonomics](https://medium.com/@stevenzhang/rsi-tips-fd8d14b07b72), but the best ROI for that is to just stand and move every so often.

Since my back is to the door now I bought a rear view mirror. And it's easy for me to lose track of time so I got a clock to go above my desk. That way when I have full screen applications open it's easy to check.

Compred to my previous desk, it's hard for me to see views of outside, so my vision went from 20/15 to 20/30 in under 2 years. My lifestyle has been healthier when looking over that time, but in my new office I effectivley just look at a wall the entire time. So I'll likely move my deskt to a different wall so I can better see out the window. Along with cleaning the window more so I can better look outside and focus on far objects to keep eyes healthy.
