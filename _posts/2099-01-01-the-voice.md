title: "The Voice"
---

In a past life I used to write for the student newspaper the [Ka Leo](https://www.manoanow.org/kaleo/), meaning "the voice" in Hawaiian.

At the time I remember wanting to stretch myself intellectually in a way that I never had, while also having something public to show for it.

The paper paid about $50 for a published story, a few of mines did (and I wish I kept the prints) but I remember that that procress to get paid for them was so obtuse I didn't bother.

This all came to mine while watching [The Paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paper_(2025_TV_series)) with my partner, so before my stories are lost before they can be saved to the the internet archive, I've decided to save them here for posterity.

The hardest part was getting quotes since you'd have to find a time that worked with you and the faculty member you wanted to meet.

Student quotes were dummy easy, just ask someone on campus that was in the departments building, 9/10 they were that major.

I also remember I did this during my first sememster which was spring, then into summer, so my school load was light, then came down going full time in the fall.

also i remember some sotries were time senstative, so I think that explains how they were published after i left, im thinkign they might've saved them as needed since they had alsmost no writers.
