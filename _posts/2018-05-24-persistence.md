After completing my '30 Days of Code' challenge, while starting a new job, and studying for (and passing) the CompTIA Network+ exam, I've had to use a few techniques I've learned while in school. Some would call it staying sane, I call it avoiding burnout.

When I first started college, it wasn't hard for me and I was able to get most stuff done easily. But the next semester, as things picked up my motivation didn't and I became overwhelmed. But that was the [activation energy](https://fs.blog/2017/06/activation-energy/) I needed to take on the next semester with an intensity. Now instead of being stressed, I was excited. And by excited I mean I was able to overcome my stress with enthusiasm. Two major pieces of work that stuck with me that I came across during that time were the following:

* [Persistence](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4276820/quotes/qt3321348?mavIsAdult=false&amp;mavCanonicalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt4276820%2Fquotes): Said by Calvin Coolidge, which is then quoted by Michael Keaton, in the bio-pic of Ray Kroc.
* [Were you one of the "smart kids"?](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/3piu8r/advice_were_you_one_of_the_smart_kids/): How many people's idea of intelligence is what causes them to become distraught and disappointed with their accomplishments.

This went on for about a year, but half way through I lost my momentum and 'burned-out'. It was during spring break, so my hard work from the beginning of the semester made up for my laziness near the end. Then after unwinding during the summer I lost the fire and was in a daze for a while. Then once I had a few months to recover I snapped back to reality and was back in the saddle.

It's a story not too uncommon in the tech industry, but a few article I read during my recovery were major helps with the recovery process:

* [Brain in a Jar](http://stephaniehurlburt.com/blog/2017/4/15/brain-in-a-jar): Your mind is the captain, but you body is the vessel. Maintaining your health (body) is just as important as maintaining your skills (mind).
* [Recovering from Burnout](https://kierantie.com/burnout/): The explanation is in the title, but like in the '7 Habits of Highly Effective People', guarding against burn-out is just as, if not more important than self-improvement.

I'd say that my zoom-and-boom was a great learning experience in a fairly forgiving environment compared to others who're working and have bills. I also have to thank friends and family that helped me through it all. If I were to impart any wisdom onto you from all this, it'd be 'Know your limits' and 'No man is an island.'
