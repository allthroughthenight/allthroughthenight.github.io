After completing the '30 day coding challenge', while starting a new job, and studying for (and passing) the CompTIA Network+ exam, I've had to use a few techniques I've learned while in school. Some would call it staying sane, I call it avoiding burnout.

When I first started college, it wasn't very difficult and I was able to get most stuff done easily. But the next semester, as things picked up my motivation didn't and I became overwhelmed. Then like a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly, I took on the following semester's material voraciously. Now instead of being stressed, I was just excited. And by excited I mean I was able to overcome my stress with passion. Two major pieces of work that stuck with me that I came across during that time were the following:

* [Persistence](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4276820/quotes/qt3321348?mavIsAdult=false&amp;mavCanonicalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt4276820%2Fquotes) - Said by Calvin Coolidge, which is then quoted by Michael Keaton, in the bio-pic of Ray Kroc.
* [Were you one of the "smart kids"?](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/3piu8r/advice_were_you_one_of_the_smart_kids/) - A long post by reddit's standards. It talks about how many people's idea of intelligence is what causes them to become distraught and disappointed with their accomplishments.

This went on for about a year, but about half way through that I realized that I couldn't sustain the momentum and I 'burned-out'. It was during spring break, so my hard work from the beginning of the semester made up for my laziness near the end. After unwinding during the summer I lost the fire and was in a daze for a while. Then a few months I snapped back to reality and was back in the saddle.

It's a story not too uncommon in the tech industry, but a few article I read during my recovery were major helps with the recovery process:

* [Brain in a Jar](http://stephaniehurlburt.com/blog/2017/4/15/brain-in-a-jar) - Your mind is the captain, but you body is the vessel. Maintaining your health is just as important as maintaining your skills.
* [Recovering from Burnout](https://kierantie.com/burnout/) - The explanation is in the title, but just like in the '7 Habits of Highly Effective People', guarding against burn-out is just as, if not more important than self-improvement.

I'd say that my zoom-and-boom was a great learning experience in a fairly forgiving environment compared to others who're working and have bills. I also have to thank friends and family that helped me through it all. If I were to impart any wisdom onto you from all this, it'd be 'Know your limits' and 'No man is an island.'
