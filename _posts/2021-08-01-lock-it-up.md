# Introduction

I have a talk for some seasonal work coming up, and having to relate it back to tech for the average user, one thing I always mention is how most password policies are broken and causes most people to have bad habits. I'll be writing this post in a Q&A style to help you explain to others what we'll be covering.

# Why should I care about my passwords?

Most don't give a second thought about the password they use for sites. Most times you'll be required for it to include a special character, number, or capital letter. This way it's harder to guess and less likely to be compromised. But everyone has a story about how they know someone that got hacked, but don't think it could every happen to them.

# I use a strong password, why would I be worried?

Password complexity is good, but often people will take shortcuts that will undermine them. This xkcd comic about [password strength](https://xkcd.com/936/) summarizes the problems best. If there're requirements, most will do the minimum, which can end up making a password that's easier to [crack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking), and harder for yourself to remember, so you're more likely to write it down or save it an unsecured way.

# But what if I reuse the same password so I only have to remember one?

[Password reuse](https://xkcd.com/792/) is the easiest ways that most people  [get pwned](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pwned). Even if your password is so secure it'd take [billions of years to crack](https://howsecureismypassword.net/), if only one site that you use it on get's hacked, now all of the sites you use it on are hacked.

# How do I know if my password has been leaked?

You can search on [have i been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to see if your password, email, or phone number has been involved in any leak. [Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.firefox.com/) also does the same by actively monitoring leaks any email you provide.

# Isn't remembering a lot of passwords hard?

It can be simplified with a few tools. There are a few xkcd inspired password generators but I think they're either [too simple](https://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/) or [too complex](https://xkpasswd.net/s/). The best in-between I've found is [Dinopass's](https://www.dinopass.com/) strong password option. It breaks up dictionary words with simple non-alphanumeric characters, and adding on more characters isn't hat hard.

To keep track of all your new passwords, use a password manger like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) (recommended) or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) ([not recommended](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26153845)).

# Does changing my password help?

[This post](https://auth0.com/blog/dont-pass-on-the-new-nist-password-guidelines/) summarizes [NIST's](https://www.nist.gov/) current guidance, which is that length is better than complexity, and changing often doesn't help as much as you think. As mentioned before, when inconvinicened most will make shortcuts, and either use a weak passwords, or just start reusing them again.

# I have a bunch of passwords, can't they still get hacked?

It's a good idea to use [multi-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication), whether it's just SMS texts/emails, or apps like the [Google Authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator) or [Duo](https://duo.com/). Just remember that you'll also need a way recover an account in case you lose an authenticator, usually with single use codes and/or recovery questions. Now if any of your passwords are leaked, even if someone had them, they'd still need access to you phone.

# [Potpourri](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/potpourri), [Speculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_foil_hat), and [Well Actually's](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules)

* SMS two-factor authentication isn't 100% secure
    * Yes, SIM-swapping attacks have become easier, but they're targeted, and having 2FA is more secure than not having it. And if it's the only 2Fa a service offers I'd recommend it 100% of the time.
* A [random password generator](https://passwordsgenerator.net/) is more secure than a "horse-battery-staple" since it'd be larger 
    * [Pseudorandom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness), and that isn't entirely accurate. A random string _could_ have more permutations since it's the [character set] ^ length. But a "horse-battery-staple" style string would be [every english word] ^ [number of words]. Off-the-cuff, I'm sure the latter might have not as many permutation, but we're talking by millions when they're already in the order of billions. You can also strengthen the latter by including a extra special character to break up dictionary word. And finally, passwords are meant for people to type it, so if you end up having to input it manually, "horse-battery-staple" is a lot easier than "random string".

# Anything else?

If you need to make an online account but aren't sure about your (or their) commitment, it might be worth using a throw away email like [temp-mail](https://temp-mail.org/). Or if you want something more permanent but still somewhat anonymous, [mail.com](https://www.mail.com/) is a great option too.

Make sure that when you advocate for someone to use unique passwords and a password manager, understand that most people don't think or worry about being hacked, so just focusing on keeping things simple to ease their adoption.
