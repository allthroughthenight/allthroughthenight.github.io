# Introduction

I have a talk for seasonal work coming up, and having to relate it back to tech for the average user, one thing I always mention is how most password policies are broken and causes people to do really bad things. I'll be writing this post in a Q&A style to help you explain to others what we'll be covering.

# Why should I care about my passwords?

I'm betting most don't give a second thought about the password they use for sites. Most times you'll be required for it to include a special character, number, or capital letter. This way it's harder to guess and less likely to be comprimised.

# I use a fancy password, why would I be worried?

Password complexity is good, but often people will take shortcuts that will undermine them. This xkcd comic about [password strength](https://xkcd.com/936/) which summarized the problems best. If you're required a few things, then all most will do, which can end up making a password that's easier to [crack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking), and make it harder for yourself to remember.

# I can just reuse the same complex password so I only have to remember one

[Password reuse](https://xkcd.com/792/) is the easiest ways that most people  [get pwned](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pwned). Even if your password is so secure it'd take [billions of years to crack](https://howsecureismypassword.net/), if only one site that you use it on get's hacked, now all of the sites you use it on are hacked.

# How do I know if my password has been leaked?

You can search on [have i been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to see if your password, email, or phone number has been involved in any leak. [Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.firefox.com/) also does the same by activley monitoring leaks any email you provide.

# Remembering a bunch of passwords is hard

It can be simplified with a few tools. There are a few xkcd inspired password generators but I think they're either [too simple](https://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/) or [too complex](https://xkpasswd.net/s/). The best in-between I've found is [Dinopass's](https://www.dinopass.com/) strong password option. It breaks up dictionary words with simple non-alphanumeric characters, and adding on more characters isn't hat hard.

To keep track of all your new passwords, use a password manger like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) (recommended) or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) ([not recommended](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26153845)).

# Does changing my password help?

[This post](https://auth0.com/blog/dont-pass-on-the-new-nist-password-guidelines/) summarizes [NIST's](https://www.nist.gov/) current guidance, which is that length is better than complexity, and changing often doesn't help as much as you think. As mentioned before, when inconvinicend most will make shortcuts, and either use a weak passwords, or just start reusing them again.

# So I have a bunch of unique passwords, but can't they still get leaked?

To add another layer for you most important accounts, to include you password manager, it's a good idea to use [multi-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication). Whether it be simple like SMS texts and emails, or more secure like the [Google Authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator) or [Duo](https://duo.com/). Just keep in mind that you'll also want to have a way some type of recovery method (usually single use codes and/or recovery questions). Now if any of your passwords are leaked, even if someone had them, they'd still need access to you phone for authentiction codes via text or from an app.

# Anything else?

If need to make an online account but aren't sure about your (or their) commitment, it might be worth using a throw away email like [temp-mail](https://temp-mail.org/). Or if you want something more permanent but still somewhat anonymous, [mail.com](https://www.mail.com/) is a great option too.

# Technicalities, [Well Actually's](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules), and Potpourri

* SMS two-factor authentication isn't 100% secure
** Yes, but it's more secure than not having it. And if it's all a service offer I'd recommend it 100% of the time.
* A [random password generator](https://passwordsgenerator.net/) is more secure than a "horse-battery-staple" since it'd be larger 
** [Pseudorandom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness), and that argument this isn't accurate. A random string _could_ have more permutations since it'd be [characer set] ^ length. But a "horse-battery-staple" would also be [every english word] ^ [number of words]. Off-the-cuff, I'm sure the latter might be _a bit_ smaller, but we're talking by millions for both that might be in the billions. You can also strengthen the latter by including a extra special charater to break up dictionary word. And finally, passwords are meant for people to type it, and it doesn't help are for people, not machines. [an attacker only have to
