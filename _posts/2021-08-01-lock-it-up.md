# Introduction

I have a talk for seasonal work coming up, and having to relate it back to tech for the average user, one thing I always mention is how most password policies are broken and causes people to do really bad things. I'll be writing this post in a Q&A style to help you explain to others what we'll be covering.

# Why should I care about my passwords?

I'm betting most don't give a second thought about the password they use for sites. Most times you'll be required for it to include a special character, number, or capital letter. This way it's harder to guess and less likely to be comprimised.

# I use a complex password, so should I be worried?

Password complexity is good, but often people will take shortcuts that will undermine it. See this xkcd comics about [password strength](https://xkcd.com/936/) which sucintly explains the problems with password complexity requirements. To summarize it, if you're only required one special character, number, and capitial letter, that's all you'll do. In the process you'll make a password that's shorters and easier to [crack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking), and at the same time make it harder for yourself to remember. 

# I'll just make my password more complex, then I can use it for other websites and only have to remember one

This raises another problem, [password reuse](https://xkcd.com/792/) is one of the easiest ways that most people  [get pwned](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pwned). Even if your password is so secure it'd take [billions of years to crack](https://howsecureismypassword.net/), if only one site that you use it on get's hacker, now all of the sites you use it on are hacked.

# How do I know if my password has been leaked?

You can search  on [have i been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to see if your password, email, or phone number has been involved in any leak. [Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.firefox.com/) also does the same by activley monitoring leaks any email you provide.

# But making and remembering a bunch of different passwords is hard?

It is, but it can be greatly simplified with a few tools. There are a few xkcd inspired password generators but they can be either [too simple](https://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/) or [too complex](https://xkpasswd.net/s/). The best in-between I've found is [Dinopass's](https://www.dinopass.com/) strong password option. It breaks up dictionary words with simple non-alphanumeric characters, and if you need more you can add them on as needed.

To keep track of all your new passwords, use a password manger like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) (recommended) or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) ([not recommended](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26153845)).

# Does changing my password help?

[This post](https://auth0.com/blog/dont-pass-on-the-new-nist-password-guidelines/) summarizes [NIST's](https://www.nist.gov/) current guidance, which is that length is better than complexity, and changing often doesn't help as much as you think. As mentioned before, when inconvinicend most will make shortcuts, and either use a weak passwords, or just start reusing them again.

# So I have a bunch of unique passwords, is that it?

To add another layer for you most important accounts (to include you password manager) it's a good idea to use [multi-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication). Whether it be simple like SMS texts and emails, or more secure like the [Google Authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator) or [Duo](https://duo.com/). Just keep in mind that you'll also want to have a way some type of recovery method (usually single use codes and/or recovery questions).

But again, I wouldn't suggest enabling this for every account. It might not make sense to worry about managing extra authentication and recovery codes for that one car forum you post under a psydonym every blue moon. Instead this will greatly help with important accounts like banking, you primary email address (which you use for recovering/resetting passwords for other accounts) and other "non-critical" sites that don't have personal information, but if stolen would be damaging. like social media or cloud storage accounts.
