title: "Landing Late"

Another addition to my job search saga ([1](https://allthroughthenight.github.io/2021/03/01/my-interviewing-success.html), [2](https://allthroughthenight.github.io/2024/11/01/the-new-job-market.md)). I recently accepted a role, so I'm here to share my failures and successes.

A major difference this time around was that I put a lot more effort into applications and studying since winter and spring are when companies pick up hiring.
