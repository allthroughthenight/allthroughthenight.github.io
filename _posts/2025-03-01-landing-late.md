title: "Landing Late"
---

Another addition to my job search saga ([1](https://allthroughthenight.github.io/2021/03/01/my-interviewing-success.html), [2](https://allthroughthenight.github.io/2024/11/01/the-new-job-market.md)). A major difference this time around was that I put a lot more effort into applications and studying since winter and spring are when companies pick up hiring. I recently accepted a role, so I'm here to share my failures and successes.

Also I made sure that I had prepackaged technical stories, with aspects that'd fit into any behavioral question archetypes. This allowed me to then focus on the S.T.A.R. format to best answer the question and allow the interviewer to understand the story. This is in contrast to how I used to be with my technical stories with me just rambling about "This one time...".

Overall the entire job market is bad. So make sure you stay ready so you don't have to get ready.
