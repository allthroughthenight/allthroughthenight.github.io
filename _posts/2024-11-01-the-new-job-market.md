title: "The New Job Market"

Same as my [previous job search](https://allthroughthenight.github.io/2021/03/01/my-interviewing-success.html), I kept track this time around too.

A major change from last time was to 1) apply to positions directly 2) work with recruiters and 3) get referral. When it comes to the interview process, after the HR screen you go through some technical rounds, so I simplified them to just a technical screen (remote coding challenge, HM talk) and final round (live coding challenge, behavioral question, meet the team, bar raisers).

A main point to keep in mind is that this data is really only for about half the year. Due to other seasonal work I was busy from January till May. Also due to the nature of the work I wouldn't have been able to take time off to conduct any technical interviews. Yes I still had time to study and do HR screening calls. But being able to take the time to sit down and do my best at a coding screen wouldn't have been possible without my work suffering.

I'm not too worried about the total applied amount. I use my browsers autofill function, so applying to 5 position takes about 5 minutes at most. And like others who're applying, with it being so easy, many desirable position will get hundreds of applicants within the first hour. I've also heard of some using tools to automatically find and apply to positions, making cold applying numbers mean even less to me.

The most surprising to me is when recruiters reached out directly ghost me. The worst for me was after having a good first call, I reached out a few times but they ghosted me for ~2 months. They then followed up with "we have proof we sent you an email, so I'm not sure what happened, but now the position is filled so ttyl". I guess they tried to save face by saying it was a technical issue, but an an automatic rejection email would've been better.

I've been appreciative of the referrals I've received. Some have been basic with just a referral code to use when applying. Others have been very personal with them forwarding my resume directly to their hiring manager internally.

As a mid career professional, the main change with the interviews I've had is that they care more about your technical stories and accomplishments. The understanding is that since you've been working professionally for a while technical adptitude is expected. But as you move into more senior positions, you need to show your ability to comminucate your work and elevate those around you.

I entered the tech industry before the pandemic and it was the cool place to work. Massages, free food, pool tables, along with great compensation packages. When the pandemic started, hiring increased since work from home increased companies talent pools from their local area to the entire world. Workers saw that with hiring increasing they could move companies too, while also increasing their career trajectory. As the pandemic ended and balance sheets were checked, companies realized they overhired and started reducing headcount. As a final push, many mandated return to office policies to force more resignations. With interest rate lowering and AI tooling making work easier, some hiring has resumed. But experts say (and anectdotally) that tech hiring likely won't return to pre-pandemic levels within our lifetime.

I've compiled notes, sites, and resources as I interviewed this past year and made them into a [document you can download](/assets/2024-11-01-the-new-job-market/interview-prep-guide.pdf). Feel free to check it out and share it if you'd like.

There's also been a lot of talk about and usage of AI tools to make applying and screening candidates easier. This has lead to an arms race of AI detections and prompt injection resumes. Which reminded me of this hn quote from a [past post of mine]({{site.baseurl}}/2022/01/01/what-i-learned-this-year.html).

[on: The computers rejecting job applications](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26065594):
> The next logical step would be to train an adversarial AI against the hiring AI. You'd have the system generate your resume and application to maximize your chances. Then the hiring AI would need to be re-trained to account for this. And so on.
> In the far future, this feedback loop creates an economy where every job application is total gibberish. No human can possibly explain why their resume is a recipe for carne asada, an excerpt from Moby Dick, and a bunch of windings. But supposedly it's predicted to increase final offer salary by 13.54%, so nobody questions it. Anybody who still writes out their resume by hand is considered a luddite weirdo, and definitely not someone you'd want to have join your company.
