title: "The Ground Truth"

Having applied to over 300 jobs the past year-ish, and checking LinkedIn regularly for recruiter messages, there is still a major disconnect between the average candidate and hiring manager.

To better explain how a hiring procress goes, here's the steps

- An HM needs a position filled
- The HM asks HR to open a req for the position
- They discuss qualifications and compensation
- HR posts the position
- Candidats apply
- The ATS filters resumes that meet basic qualification, including hard requirements (Export control, work status) but excluding protected statuses (Age, gender, ethnicity)
- Of those filtered, the ATS system recommends the best candidates
- HR manually reviews the recommendations, then forwards their best picks to the HM
- The HM selects the candidates they want to interview
- HR schedules the interview

Of these steps, the biggest filter it the ATS and the random 

Here are some tips that are directly related to what I've seen
- Automation is king: Use autofill, or any othe tools you can find to apply to more jobs faster. It's a numbers game. Any application that says "Don't use AI" you can ignore.

- Don't tailor your resume: Unless you're automating this it's time wasted. It might get you top ranked by an ATS, but when it comes to the lottery it doesn't make a difference. Since some hiring processes take the first X number of candidates, you're better off being first to apply.

- Numbes don't matter: It can be dishearting to apply to 50 positions, get ghosted by 45, and rejected by 5. But believe me when I say the people and systems on the other end don't have any remorse. It's just business, it's not personal, so don't take it personally.

- Use an email filter: With all the applications you're putting 

- Have anonymous contact information: When I first started my job search out of college, I used my .edu email and personal phone number. My .edu email wasn't a major issue, but it was a major signal that I was a new grad. And using my personal phone number was bad also, since once my information was sold I was getting bombarded by sketchy jobs and just straight spam. This time around I used a psudo professional email address (which I also use for all my unimportnat accounts to avoid spam) and I used my Google voice number instead. This has helped a lot with getting false positives. There's been a few times a position has been too good to be true, so I communicate with them through my alternate accounts, then once they show their had I end contact.

- one-click apply is okay: I've applyed with one-click (indeed, LinkedIn, Dice) for maybe 200 positions. But I also didn't expect anything from them. On a certain level I considred it my own busy work. But to sit and just do nothing because something is futile isn't in my nature.

- LinkedIn is alright: 

The tone of this post might seem harsh. But when it comes to making a living to pay your bills. you need to be best equiped to take on the challenges of the new job market.
