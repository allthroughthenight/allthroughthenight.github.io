[This post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41646531) came up and made me look back at my own blog. It's weird to think that I've been blogging for 7 years. I made it just to try it out, then after awhile it just becomes a part of what I do. It feels like a chores having think about new posts or revising previous posts. But also it's a blessing that I've had access to the tools to make this possible, and the health to continue on with this. I don't think I'll really celebrate until I hit 10 year.  So until then, we'll just keep doing what we're doing.
