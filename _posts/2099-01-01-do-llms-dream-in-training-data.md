title: "Do LLMs Dream in Training Data?"
---

Whenever I take a break from podcasts, everytime I come back I forget how much I enjoy them. They're self contained, and designed for people with busy hands but clear minds, so I can listen to them while I'm doing other things I need to get done.

Being a chronic hackernews surfer, [this post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41503835) talked about turning books into audiobooks, which then mentioned what about other sites, and of course a podcast aroudn that for hackernews already existed. I listed to an episode and I was hooked. It does what I use the site for, seeing the general consensus of other tech workers about trending topics related to America and the western world.

Like other comments have mentioned it does get [some pronouciation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35831177) wrong.

And in a moment of bliss, it brought to mind other AI and LLM articles and topics that've stuck with me this year, or reminded me of other stuff.

From 2022-01-01-what-i-learned-this-year.md
[on: The computers rejecting job applications](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26065594):
> The next logical step would be to train an adversarial AI against the hiring AI. You'd have the system generate your resume and application to maximize your chances. Then the hiring AI would need to be re-trained to account for this. And so on.
> In the far future, this feedback loop creates an economy where every job application is total gibberish. No human can possibly explain why their resume is a recipe for carne asada, an excerpt from Moby Dick, and a bunch of windings. But supposedly it's predicted to increase final offer salary by 13.54%, so nobody questions it. Anybody who still writes out their resume by hand is considered a luddite weirdo, and definitely not someone you'd want to have join your company.
