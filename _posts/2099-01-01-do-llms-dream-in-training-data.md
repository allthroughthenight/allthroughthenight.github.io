title: "Do LLMs Dream in Training Data?"
---

Everytime I come back to podcasts I forget how much I enjoy them. Self contained, for people with busy hands but clear minds, so I can listen to them while I'm doing other things I need to get done.

Being a chronic hackernews reader, [this post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41502510) talked about turning books into audiobooks, then about podcasts, and then mentioning [Hacker News Recap](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41503835). After listing to an episode and I was hooked. It does what I read the site for, seeing the general consensus about trending tech news. Besides [some pronouciation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35833110) issues I would recommended it to everyone.

Also related to all the LLM and AI hype this year, I've also listed below some other sites and stories that've stood out to me. 

[The Intelligence Age](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41628167): Talking with friends this seemed like the next step. From transistors, to microchips, to the information age, to the ai age.

Prompts for certrain fields - https://www.aiforwork.co/: I've seen a few sites like this pop up, but in my experience prompt engineering as a whole is only pertinent if you either 1) don't know the problem space or 2) have limited usage of the LLM. If you don't know what to ask, then you don't know enough to get started. But if you're able to continually just 'figure it out' then precise prompts from the start don't help you better know what you need to learn.

[on: The computers rejecting job applications](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26065594):
> The next logical step would be to train an adversarial AI against the hiring AI. You'd have the system generate your resume and application to maximize your chances. Then the hiring AI would need to be re-trained to account for this. And so on.
> In the far future, this feedback loop creates an economy where every job application is total gibberish. No human can possibly explain why their resume is a recipe for carne asada, an excerpt from Moby Dick, and a bunch of windings. But supposedly it's predicted to increase final offer salary by 13.54%, so nobody questions it. Anybody who still writes out their resume by hand is considered a luddite weirdo, and definitely not someone you'd want to have join your company.
