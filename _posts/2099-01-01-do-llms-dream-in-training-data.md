title: "Do LLMs Dream in Training Data?"
---

Whenever I take a break from podcasts, everytime I come back to them I forget how much I enjoy them. They're self contained and designed for people with busy hands but clear minds, so I can listen to them while I'm doing other things I need to get done.

Being a chronic hackernews surfer, [this post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41503835) talked about turning books into audiobooks, which then mentioned what about other sites, and of course a podcast aroudn that for hackernews already existed. I listed to an episode and I was hooked. It does what I use the site for, seeing the general consensus of other tech workers about trending topics related to America and the western world.

Like other comments have mentioned it does get [some pronouciation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35831177) wrong.

And in a brain blast sort of moment, it brought to mind all the other AI and LLM articles and topics that've stuck with me this year. 

The Intelligence Age: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41628167 - Talking with friends this seemed like the next step. From transistors, to microchips, to the information age, to the ai age.

Prompts for certrain fields - https://www.aiforwork.co/: I've seen a few sites like this pop up, but in my experience prompt engineering as a whole is only pertinent if you either 1) don't know the problem space or 2) have limited usage of the LLM. If you don't know what to ask, then you don't know enough to get started. But if you're able to continually just 'figure it out' then precise prompts from the start don't help you better know what you need to learn.

[on: The computers rejecting job applications](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26065594):
> The next logical step would be to train an adversarial AI against the hiring AI. You'd have the system generate your resume and application to maximize your chances. Then the hiring AI would need to be re-trained to account for this. And so on.
> In the far future, this feedback loop creates an economy where every job application is total gibberish. No human can possibly explain why their resume is a recipe for carne asada, an excerpt from Moby Dick, and a bunch of windings. But supposedly it's predicted to increase final offer salary by 13.54%, so nobody questions it. Anybody who still writes out their resume by hand is considered a luddite weirdo, and definitely not someone you'd want to have join your company.
