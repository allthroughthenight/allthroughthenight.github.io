title: "Cold Email"
---

I like to think that the internet is still a fun and wacky place. I like to confirm this every now and then by emailing people I admire. Sending letters in the mail was a bit risky becuase they'd have your actual address, or you'd have to pay for a PO Box. Now days writing a letter takes effort (getting paper, packing an envelope, postage, taking it to a mail box) but my impression would be that back in the day since letters were more common the effort wasn't seen as high.

When email first started it was a novelty, then fun (think AOL IM), then it was enshitified by spammers.

Segue about spam emails. Growing up in pacific islander culture, spam is revered (see [Spam Jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_Jam)) so I didn't understand the relation between delicious fried luncheon meat with unwanted emails. As I grew older and interacted with more people outside of my community, I understood why spam (and canned meats in general) are frowned upon.

Back to the story, many online writers I've read don't advertise their direct email. Which is understandable. A lot of them link their pre-made socials which have some level of security and scrutiny, compared to a direct email which could be going right to their desktop email client.

Also related to cold emails, I've seen it recently as a way to get applicants for job applications. My guess is that a lot of job applications are being automated, and most email clients have good filtering. So if a applicant reads a posting and writes and email, than they at least 1) read the entire posting and 2) put in some effort to get the email together.

I've cold emailed a few, and each interaction has always been enjoyable.
