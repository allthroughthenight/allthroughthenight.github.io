title: "Cold Email"
---

I like to think that the internet is still a fun an wacky place. I like to confirm this every now and then by email people I really like. Prior to emails, sending letters in the mail was a bit risky(?) becuase they'd have your actual address, or you'd have to pay for a PO Box. Also now days writing a letter takes effort (getting paper, packing an envelope, postage, taking it to a mail box) but my impression would be that back in the day since letters were more common the effort wasn't seen as high.

When email first started it was a novelty, then fun (think AOL IM), then it went to shit with spam emails

Segue about spam emails. Growing up in a pacific islander culture, spam is revered (see spam festival) so I didn't understand you could related delicious fried luncheon meat with unwanted emails. Then as I grew older and interacted with more people outside of my community that spam (and canned meats in general) are frowned upon.

BAck to the story, many online writers I've read don't advertise their direct email. Which is understandable. A lot of them link their pre-made socials which have some level of security and scrutiny, compared to a direct email which could be going right to their desktop email client.

I've cold emailed a few creators, but each interaction has been failry enjoyable. The basic template for my emails are:

<Salutation>
Hey Grant

<How I know you and your work>
I knew you were part of the O-group, but I didn't expect to see you on Selling Sunsets.

<Words of encouragement>
I'm really enjoying the show, hope to see you on there more!

<Ending>
