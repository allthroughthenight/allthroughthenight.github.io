title: "The Rapture"
---

The tech hype train that me and my cohort saw when we were in school left without us. Maybe we had a chance, but it'll likely never happen again. I have a friend that left Tesla and their last RSU vest. And they've been stressed about the FOMO for not [toughing it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9yTbdsL1aI). Even though our group of friends have told him not to over think it, I feel for him. Sometimes it's hard to have a chance and lose it, than to have never had it at all.
