# Introduction

Following up on my [previous post]({{site.baseurl}}/2020-08-01-my-set-up.html), this one is to highlight the changes I made to improve my WFH experience.

# Keyboard

Previously I had a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000. I always wanted one but it's around $50. One day while bumping around Best Buy I found one on sale for $20 and bought it on the spot. It served me well for a few years, and the ergonomic design helped with some RSI I was having, but it wasn't perfect. It's size made it clunky, the space bar felt wobbly, and the overall build quality wasn't great. So the next step was a [split mechanical keyboard](https://github.com/diimdeep/awesome-split-keyboards)

Most cost a premium ([ErgoDox](https://ergodox-ez.com/), [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/)). Looking around more, the [Iris keyboard](https://keeb.io/collections/iris-split-ergonomic-keyboard) is one of the few that are available and affordable. My current daily driver is a [Ducky One 2 Mini](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One2-Mini-Pure-White-RGB) with Cherry MX Blues. I like the switches but I wanted "quiet clickey switches" which means "tactile switches" which means "Glorious Holy Pandas". For the keykaps, I went with a cheap ortholinear set I found on Amazon.

My future plans aren't ambitious, just tenting and nicer keycaps. My real end goal is a [Dactyl Manuform](https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform), but I want to first get comfortable with a split and ortholiear keyboard before I jump into one that's also parameterized and concaved.

I'd also like to change it from the [default layout](https://docs.keeb.io/assets/files/keymap_Iris_rev5-d4bcf1f19bc0d06c9bd96e9bd73efbd0.pdf) to move around some things. But again, I'll leave it as is to get used to the form factor. 

# Desk

Overall the same as my [previous post]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/08/01/my-set-up.html), but I've cleared up some desk space by mounting my speakers underneath and done better cable management now that I have a cat. I also got rid of the trackball and just got a wireless mouse.
