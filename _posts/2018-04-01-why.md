title: "Why?"

Without a set schedule, my daily learning has taken a dive. By making a personal blog and posting regularly, I want to be more accountable for my self-improvement, and cultivate a more employable skill-set. I'll keep this blog focused on tech and my trials and tribulations trying to making it work for me. I donâ€™t expect anything out of this, but I just hope anyone who visits can learn something.
