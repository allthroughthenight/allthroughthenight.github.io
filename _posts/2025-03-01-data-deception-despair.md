title: "Data Deception Despair"
---

The [NPD leak](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220212/national-public-data-breach-social-security-3-billion) is the largest data leak of PII in American history. It includes phone numbers, address, emails, and full names. Those combined would allow most attackers to easily take over enough accounts to make some money. Instead the vector attackers have chosen is a lot more impersonal.

For myself, it was a normal morning, till I saw the email below.

Becuase of my aggressive email filtering, getting the email directly to my personal inbox from a random gmail with my full name and address was shocking. I check all the email info to confirm it wasn't a fluke (ignore the spam banner, that was after the fact).

I opened the attatchment in the browser and started reading.

The first part is still shocking, with my full name and address, along with a street vi- wait. I've looked at my place from google street enough to know where this picture was from. Also I had the [Google street view of my place removed](https://www.aarp.org/home-family/personal-technology/info-2021/remove-home-from-google-street-view.html). So that explains why the view is off angle. When they tried to get a view of my place it didn't work and settled for the off angle view. This is getting weirder, but let's keep reading.

Okay this is just some kinda extortion. I'm 98% sure I'm safe to ignore it, and I made sure not to download any attachments. If they have any tracking pixels in the email that's fine, but overall it's feels about as dangerous as any other dodgey link.

A lot of the techno-bable is close enough at a glance, but once you go below surface level it all falls apart. And knowing a bit of cyber security and cyber crime, if they had a rootkit to any device you owned, manually monitoring cameras and website history is too much work for an extortion. It'd be easier to do a ransomware attack or sniff for passwords.

I showed this to my partner and they just laughed immediatly after the first paragraph. Outside of my context which is "an email to my inbox is real" they saw through it right away. I deleted the email without incident, but decided to look online and see what others had to say. [This reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1ev091l/this_is_what_a_hackerscammer_is_sending_me/) post came up, so I was able to easily just toss this aside.

Overall the attack wasn't that sophisticated. But I could see it working on those who are in a bad spot or not as tech litterate. I've also avoided posting the exact text to prevent myself from getting flagged, filtered, or even boosted by others searching this up as well.

Data breaches are a big problem, and companies that aggregate public data are a danger because of situations like this can happen. I don't expect any effective legislature to take shape within my lifetime, but I hope in the future people can look back and say "that was bad, good thing we fixed it".
