The ergonomics saga continues ([part 1]({{site.baseurl}}/2025/05/01/ergonomics-part-2.html), [part 2]({{site.baseurl}}/2025/05/01/ergonomics-part-2.html), [part 3]({{site.baseurl}}/2025/11/01/ergonomics-part-3.html).

The major changes I've made this time around was move my personal PC tower to ontop of my desk to get more leg space underneath. I also got a monitor bar lamp to help with eye strain. And on top of that I mouted my existing web cam. I might upgrade it at some point since it has given me some issues, but for now it still does what I need it to.
