title: "Ergonomics Part 3"

The ergonomics saga continues ([part 1]({{site.baseurl}}/2025/05/01/ergonomics-part-2.html), [part 2]({{site.baseurl}}/2025/05/01/ergonomics-part-2.html)). I'm still using my same Alex + countertop combo, but I invested in a dedictated latop arm, and KVM for my webcam and periferals. With WFH being the norm, having a good remote presence is essential. A good mic and webcam are an easy way to elevate yourself among your peers. It's always appreciated when it's easy to see and understand the person you're working with.
