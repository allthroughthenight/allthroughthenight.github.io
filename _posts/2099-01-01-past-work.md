A continuation of [Personal Presentaions]({{site.baseurl}}/2024/08/01/personal-presentations.html) and uncovering more work I did as an undergrad.

ICS 111 Introduction to Computer Science: The goal was to write a program to [heard chickens into a coop using the drones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD_ziwnp150). It's not impossible, but this was many students first time coding, the professor wasn't good, and we had to use a custom library their graduate student wrote, so we could only really get help from the graduate students.

ICS 485 Video Game Design and Development: This class was also taught by the previous professor. A positive is that we were able to use whatever tools we wanted like Unity, so it was easy to look up things we needed to know. A negative is that they didn't teach anything, so most of us just skipped leactures and watched Unity tutorials.

Looking back at both these classes, they were taught by the same professor. As an engineer they're a genius, but as a teacher they should let someone else take over. But I am thankful they had us document our work so I'm able to look back on it now.
