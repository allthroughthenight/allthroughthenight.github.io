I like having music play when I want to focus on my work and my go to has been [lo-fi chillhop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lofi_hip_hop). Even though they're 24-hour streams they still repeat songs.

I've also found some of the beats to be distracting at time, so then I'd have to stop what I'm doing to either stop it from playing or to find something better.

Sometimes I'll also do [ambient sounds](https://asoftmurmur.com/), but even those can get distracting for me as well. An in-bewteen I've found was [generative.fm](https://play.generative.fm/browse). It give some semblance of music, while also being simple enough that it's not distracting.

Then when I need something more uptempo, I'll listen to [Lofi Generator](https://lofigenerator.com/) which resolves issues I have with the YouTube streams.

There are other services online for music generation. The best usage is for scoring shows or movies, the drawbacks are that you have to pay for them, and from what I can tell they make their money charging for each track they generate. For myself I want an endless loop, so I'll stick to my free options for now.
