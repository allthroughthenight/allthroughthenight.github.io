My go to music when working has been [lo-fi chillhop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lofi_hip_hop). It can be distracting when they repeat songs (since they're 24-hour streams) and some beats can be too much too, so I have to stop what I'm doing to change it.

Sometimes I'll try [ambient sounds](https://asoftmurmur.com/), but that can be distracting also. An in-bewteen I found was [generative.fm](https://play.generative.fm/browse). It give some semblance of music, while also being simple enough that it's not distracting.

Then when I need something more uptempo, I'll listen to [Lofi Generator](https://lofigenerator.com/) which resolves my problems with the YouTube streams.

There are other services online for music generation. The best usage is for scoring shows or movies, the drawbacks are that you have to pay for them, and from what I can tell they make their money charging for each track they generate. For myself I want an endless loop, so I'll stick to my free options.
