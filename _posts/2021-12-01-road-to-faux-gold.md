During undergrad, I made a LinkedIn profile so I could have a larger digital presence and have another link on my resume. Part of that included adding anyone to grow my network end up in more search results.

In a short while it said I couldn't have more than a certain number of pending connection requests, but if upgraded my membership I could send as many as I wanted. I didn't notice any hard blockers from their membership till then, so I decided against it since I didn't see any return from having a profile yet.

I canceled most pending requests, and only added who I knew. After a while I stopped adding people and started receiving messages from recruiters about opportunities. I'd craft a genuine response, they'd ask for a resume or schedule a call. Then it wouldn't lead anywhere and say something like "let's stay in touch" or just ghost me entirely. 

It was a bit frustrating that they were using my free time to pad their working day. But putting the two ideas together (more connections means more messages, recruiters are paid to reach out) I came up with a simple method to grow my network and make sure I had a pool of contacts to reach out to in case fell on hard times.

Firstly, I gave up on adding random people I didn't know. My guess is that either most don't check LinkedIn enough, or they're filtered since I'm not in their network. Secondly, don't waste time with a nice reply and just use a canned responses like the following:
* Recruiter: Hey I have a positions
* Me: Sounds good, let's connect
* Recruiter: Great, please click here or send me your resume
* Me: 

I feel guilty ignoring people trying to do their jobs, but they're compensated for their time while I'm not. The phrase "Your network is your net worth" is somewhat true. And while I don't think LinkedIn is a great way to get a job, it's a strong tool that's helped me progress my career.
