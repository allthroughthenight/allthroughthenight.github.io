title: "Do LLMs Dream in Training Data?"
---

[This post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41502510) talked about turning books into audiobooks, then about podcasts, and then mentions [Hacker News Recap](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41503835). After listing to one episode and I was hooked. It does what I read the site for, seeing the general consensus about trending tech news. Besides [some pronouciation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35833110) issues I would recommended it to everyone. And related to all the LLM and AI hype, I've listed a few sites and stories that've stood out to me this year.

* [AI for Work](https://www.aiforwork.co/): I've seen a few sites like this, butprompt engineering as a whole is only pertinent if you either 1) don't know the problem space or 2) have limited usage of the LLM. If you don't know what to ask, then you don't know enough to get started. And if you continually just 'figure it out' then precise prompts from the start don't help you know what you need to learn.

* [Final Round AI](https://www.finalroundai.com/): A SaaS platform that will help you navigate technical interviews. This seems like it could be dystopian, or maybe [hilarious](https://www.tiktok.com/@withsilverapp/video/7413082265556667691), but really it's just the [tip of the iceberg](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30150343) in the new era of job searches.

* [The Intelligence Age](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41628167): I remember talking with classmates about this during undergrad. From transistors, to microchips, to the information age, to the AI age.
