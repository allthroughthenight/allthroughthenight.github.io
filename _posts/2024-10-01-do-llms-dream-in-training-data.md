title: "Do LLMs Dream in Training Data?"
---

[This post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41502510) talked about turning books into audiobooks. The discussion continues about podcasts, then it's mentioned that there's the [Hacker News Recap](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41503835). After listing to one episode and I was hooked. It does what I read the site for, seeing the general consensus about trending tech news and I would highly recommended. Also related to all the LLM and AI hype, I've listed a few sites and stories that've stood out to me this year.

* [AI for Work](https://www.aiforwork.co/): I've seen a few sites like this, free and paid. But prompt engineering as a whole only matters if you either 1) don't know the problem space or 2) have limited usage of the LLM. If you don't know what to ask, then you don't know enough to get started. And if you continually just 'figure it out' then precise prompts from the start don't help you know what you need to learn. Another way I've explained it to friends who're a bit worried is that current LLMs are best when going from zero-to-one (i.e. getting started with something you have no idea about) or needing to understanding something specific for yourself (i.e. what is the context of this function call).

* [Final Round AI](https://www.finalroundai.com/): A SaaS platform that coaches you through technical interviews. It's not dystopian, just [hilarious](https://www.tiktok.com/@withsilverapp/video/7413082265556667691), and this is just the [tip of the iceberg](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30150343) in the new era of job searches.

* [The Intelligence Age](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41628167): I remember talking with classmates about this during undergrad. From transistors, to microchips, to the information age, to the AI age.
