title: "Efforts and Results"
---

The American education system, and western culture writ large, encourages working hard and doing your best. If you leave it all on the field then you shouldn't feel bad about the work you've done. The counter to this is that "if hard work pays off, then bankers would be broke".

Coporate culture likes to think it holds these same values, but the reality is starkley different. With tech companies normalizing bottom lay offs for the bottom 5-10%.

Effort Doesn't Matter, Only Results.
