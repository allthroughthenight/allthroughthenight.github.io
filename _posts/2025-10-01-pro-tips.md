Intro

Some tips I've found using tiling windows managers and vim while living off my laptop for a while.

Maybe better ways to describe these?

- Tab: Naviagtes you through a lot of apps interface objects and areas. Sometimes space works in place of enter, saving your pinky (and using your likley tougher thumb)
- Ctl + Left/Right arrow: Naviage over 'objects'. In text this is often words with common demiliting character (space, comma, slahses). But it holds in other applications also (Excel cells that are grouped, any others?)
- Up/Down in a single line input box to move to the begging or end: This works well when inputting text into forms.
- Ctl + Alt + Up/Down for collumn mode: I first ran into this in VSCode, but most any text editor now days has it enabled.
- Hold Shift to select text: Combied with other commands, it makes editing text a lot easier

Web Browser
- Alt + D: Focus address bar
- Ctl + t/w: Open a new tab and close the current tab
- Ctl + Shift t/n: Restore last closed tab/window
- DuckDuckGo bangs: Makes it a lot easier to just use the sites you want. Also pseudo bookmarks if the site you're using is specific i.e. "! local credit union" to get straight there.

Windows Specific:
- Win + Shift + s: Screenshot mode
- Win + E: Opens Windows Explorer
- Win + r: run window
