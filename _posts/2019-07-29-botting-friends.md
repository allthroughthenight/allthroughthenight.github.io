title: "Botting Friends"

Considering the lacking features of current messaging apps, and the continued growth of the gaming industry, the market was ripe for a new 'Gamer' focused messaging app. Though other online stores have tried to add on social media features, those connection are locked into their platform, and are usually disconnected from the game's own social ecosystem.

In comes [Discord](https://discordapp.com), with the ease of ability to jump in and out of voice chats when compared to Skype or Vent, but still allows for tight moderation like Slack, without the corporate image. Allowing scattered online communities to coalesce in one place.

For me and my friends, it's been a great way to keep in touch without having to force interaction, which can make maintaining friendships a burden or chore, which in turn causes them to fizzle out. An example of this working for us with with our `#lounge` voice channel. If you're just hanging out, but willing to chat, you can join the voice channel. Others will see you there and can drop in and out as they please. This somewhat replicates what it's like with real world gather places by letting interaction happen naturally and organically instead of having to set up a call for a one-on-one talk.

Though I like to think that I keep my circle of friends small, it was a matter of time till I knew that others would be invited that I might not know. To keep things lively, and help a bit with moderation, I looked for add-ons that could help.

Having joined other severs, a lot had off-the-shelf or custom bots to help with taming the masses. For me, the main things I wanted a bot for were:

1. Automated posting
2. Interaction
3. Role assignment

For #1, [MEE6](https://mee6.xyz) covered Twitch streamers pretty well. There are a few big name we all liked, but mostly to advertise when any of us or our friends were live then everyone could know.

Another thing we wanted to automatically post was from various subreddits, specifically [r/buildapcsales](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales) and [r/GameDeals](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/). Though MEE6 has a subreddit follow feature, it echos **all** posts which is too much. Looking around, I found a [web-hook write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/5lvtp3/on_popular_requestrelay_new_posts_of_a_subreddit/) for [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) that only reposts what's hot for a given subreddit.

When trying out #2, I saw a few cool bots that could do some stuff. Some had jokes, [Pokecord](https://www.pokecord.com) allows you to play Pokemon via messaging. But overall most seemed like a bit too much for just the few of us, so I just settled on wanted a bot to reply with [copypastas](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta) to certain trigger words. Trying out some other bots in a test sever, I settled on Yet Another General Purpose Discord Bot [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz). As a bonus, my friend also added [Groovy](https://groovy.bot) which is a DJ for voice chats. So we can put on music while playing another game, chatting, or bomb another chat with some audio clip.

As for #3, I initially tried MEE6's built in bot commands that allow for adding and removing roles, then made a channel specifically for giving it commands to avoid filling up other channels. Though most liked it, setting it up for each role was rough since you had to make a add **and** remove command for each role. Looking into YAGPDB more, it has the ability to make [role-menus](https://docs.yagpdb.xyz/tools-and-utilities/self-assignable-roles) which allows users to self assign roles by reacting to a 'menu' message. 

Overall we're all very satisfied with how the server is running. It does feel a bit odd to have the bots 'make noise' to make it seem more active than it really is. But it does server as a reason for us to check in every now and then, which helps with us 'bumping' into each other and making staying in touch easy. Which is always a good thing.
