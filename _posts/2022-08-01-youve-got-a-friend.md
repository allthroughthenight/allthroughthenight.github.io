title: "You've Got a Friend"
---

Aging in America is mostly centered around education. Graduating from elementary to intermediate/middle school is associated with puberty. Graduating from high school is many a coming of age stories. Sometimes instead of high school college is used as a back drop instead.

With popular sitcoms of the 90s focusing on adult friend groups (Friends, Sienfield) it seemed like friendship in adulthood is a natural progression.

Instead the loneliness epidemic is greater thn ever. And anecdodatly, seeing my family and friends age, they've mentioned and seen their friends less.

What I haven't seen disucussed about this is that besides our partner and immediate family, relationships don't last forever. Some friendships are situational, circumstancial, or you just grow out of.

I've thought about this idea for a while, and how I had many close friends in high school, then afterwards we didn't keep in touch. And when the same happened again in college I knew it couldn't be juts me. 

Years later I stumbled upon this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GulsheVZQmWDrqxBYEUZE) decsribing the phenomenon more elieuqntly. Later that day I looked around more and found [an article](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/10-types-odd-friendships-youre-probably-part.html) describing the same too.

[This chart](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/time-spent-with-relationships-by-age-us) visually depicts how we naturally become loneliner as we age. 

Like everything else, relationships aren't meant to last forever. This doesn't make me sad about my inevitable loneliness, but makes me want to appraciate the relationships I have now, while I still have them, and can enjoy them.
