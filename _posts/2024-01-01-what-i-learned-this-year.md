title: "What I Learned This Year - 2023"
---

# Introduction

2023 was a busy year for me professionally and personally, so I didn't make the time for my own personal development. I didn't write any posts this year, and this will be my shortest 'What I Learned This Year' post so far. Also I've converted; lists (bullet or numbered) should have periods. It makes them a lot more versatile.

# Articles

[Good Looking](https://github.com/EpicGames/Signup/pull/24): A low effort typo PR was created for Epic Games org sign up repo. The PR creator also pinged Epic's entire admin group of around ~40k members, causing an [email storm](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/v54yla/did_github_epic_games_just_send_62_million_spam/).

[please can I have a fucking exe?](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/11zihd4/please_can_i_have_a_fucking_exe/?sort=confidence): A redditor rant about how obtuse github is for providing basic program executables. The comments are somewhat contrasted on [r/pcmasterrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1ax1dn7/lost_treasure/).

[this code very faster](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/447): A Linux kernel PR that comments out everything so it compiles and runs faster.
