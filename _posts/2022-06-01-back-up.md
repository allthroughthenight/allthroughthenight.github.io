title: "Back Up"
---

When I got my first personal computer, I knew I needed a way to back up my files in case anything were to happen to it. This was from first hand experience having broken our family computers a few times.

I kept my usernames and passwords in a word document which I printed every few months. For files I'd used a re-writeable CD, then DVD, and eventually a USB drive. I maxed out at around a 32GB drive in high school and that held all the files I had at the time, which we mostly just MySpace and Facebook pictures of myself and my friends.

When I started my undergrad I was using a 64GB USB drive and was looking at getting a dedicated eternal SSD. As part of our school's Google Suite account we also had unlimited Google Drive Storage. This was a savior since I'd also learned about the [3-2-1 Backup Rule](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/3-2-1-backup-rule-efficient-data-protection-strategy/) around this time as well.

My first attempt at getting everything uploaded to Google Drive was a pain. Talking with some classmates one had a similar problem, and also had a worse expeirence with data loss, so they knew where I was going and how to guide me. They showed me [rclone](https://rclone.org/) which was a CLI tool that uploaded files to any cloud provider a lot faster than any web app. It also allowed you to encrypt the files on the remote end. So even if your cloud account was compromised they couldn't use the files.

And for a while this was fine. During my undergrad I only had my laptop so I didn't have to worry about syncing files between devices. 

When I graduated and started working I had a laptop and desktop for a while, but since I had a computer at work I didn't need a laptop, so instead I only worried about sycning files on my desktop. 

Since I used rclone with Linux during my undergrad, I did the same with my Windows 10 desktop by making a VM for my files back-up. This worked well for me in two ways 1) I could encrypt the VM's drive without having to encrypt my OS's drive, saving on boot time, and 2) It kept my files secure even if my desktop was compromised.

And for a while this was fine as well. I didn't have flagship smartphone, so I wasn't taking a lot of pictures, and most of my files were documents. For a while I also backed up my music collection, but stopped since I knew it'd be easier to just download it again than trying to restore it from Google Drive.

When I left for some seasonal work I brought my new personal laptop with me. Before I left I had to transfer the files from my storage VM to it. Then when I got back 3 months later I had to resync them again.

This got me thinking, is all this security worth the effort? 

clone with vm

gdrive sync, hard the first time but good for now
