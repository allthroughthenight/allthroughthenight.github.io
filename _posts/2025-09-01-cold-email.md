title: "Cold Email"
---

I have faith that the internet is still fun. So every now and then I'll directly email people I admire. When it first started it was a novelty (ARPANET) then fun (AOL IM) then it enshitified by spammers.

Segue about spam emails. Growing up around pacific island culture, spam is revered (see [Spam Jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_Jam)) so I didn't understand the relation between delicious fried luncheon meat with unwanted emails. As I grew older and interacted with more people outside of my community, I understood why spam (and canned meats in general) are frowned upon.

Also related to cold emails, recently I've seen it in job applications as a way to make sure that applicants are reading the job description. So if a applicant reads a posting and writes and email, than they at least 1) read the entire posting and 2) put in some effort to get the email together.

Back to the story; many online writers I read don't advertise their direct email, which is understandable. Most link their social media accouns which have some level of security and scrutiny, compared to a direct email which go right to their desktop email client. Over the past few years I've cold emailed a few, and each interaction has always been enjoyable.
