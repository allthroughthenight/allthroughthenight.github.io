title: "Cold Email"
---

I like to think that the internet is still a fun and wacky place. To confirm this every now and then, I'll email people I admire. When email first started it was a novelty, then fun (think AOL IM), then it was enshitified by spammers.

Segue about spam emails. Growing up with pacific islander culture, spam is revered (see [Spam Jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_Jam)) so I didn't understand the relation between delicious fried luncheon meat with unwanted emails. As I grew older and interacted with more people outside of my community, I understood why spam (and canned meats in general) is frowned upon.

Also related to cold emails, recently I've seen it in job applications as a way to make sure that applicants are reading the job description. So if a applicant reads a posting and writes and email, than they at least 1) read the entire posting and 2) put in some effort to get the email together.

Back to the story, many online writers I read don't advertise their direct email, which is understandable. A lot of them link their pre-made socials which have some level of security and scrutiny, compared to a direct email which could be going right to their desktop email client. Over the past few years I've cold emailed a few, and each interaction has always been enjoyable.
