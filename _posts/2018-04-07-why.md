title: "Why?"

In short, without a stringent schedule my daily learning has taken a dip. By making a personal blog and posting regularly, I want to be more accountable for my self-improvement, and in turn develop a more employable skill-set. I have a lot of interests, but this blog will focus on tech and my trials and tribulations making it work for me. Donâ€™t expect anything grand out of all of this, I just want everyone who visits to learn something.
