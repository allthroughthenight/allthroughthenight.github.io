On a certain level it feels like the train left without me. And I had a chance and lost it. And I know the work they're doing isn't as grandious as I thought, and the day to day is somewhat monotonous as any other coporate job.

I have a friend that left Tesla and a last RSU vest. And they've been stressing about the FOMO of not toughing it out for the final vest similar too https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9yTbdsL1aI. And even though our group of friends have told him not to over think it, I feel like alone I am.

And comparison is the theif of joy sometimes, knowing peers who're still in big tech. But I also know of a lot of others that were forced out or never even tried.
