title: "Reading More"

Late last year I needed to read through two ~400 page text books in about 2 months. At first I tried just reading them normally, then once I calculated how much time it'd actually take, I found I wouldn't be able to finish in time. I looked at some free text to speech options. Non of them did what I needed well enough, so I went with [Speechify](https://speechify.com/) which uses an annual subscription model. The biggest reason why I went with Speechify was because I could use the digital textbooks as they were and it wouldn't reformat weirdly. The next big reason was because it owuld highlight the words as it was reading. So instead of just sitting and trying to stay awake to the audio, I was able to follow along while it was reading.

After I finished the books I thought about getting back into audio books. Speechify is able to do the same with audiobooks, but other prepackages service did it better and with less fuss. 

Earlier this year my partnet signed up for Amazon Audible. I've watched them enjoy it so much I decided to sign up myself. It has some issues, but overall the content, delivery, and availability was great. Talking with some friends about it, one of them is an avid user, and has their own reading list. Talking with everyone, we decided to start our own book club. We picked out the books we wanted and got going. The only hardest requirement was that the books be less than 20 hours. That way you could easily finish them in a month. 

We're currently on our second book which was picked by my partner. An obsiouve side effect of a book club is that it keeps you accountable. You're not going to get in trouble for not finishing the book of the month, but you want to be able to talke with everyone about it and not feel left behind.
