title: "What I Learned This Year - 2026"
---

# Introduction

Being back at work this past year, I was better able to coalece my thoughts and direct my understandings into articles that resonated with me. And since AIs influence has increased, I made it into it's own section.

# Articles

[Doing the thing is doing the thing.](https://www.softwaredesign.ing/blog/doing-the-thing-is-doing-the-thing): All the thinking, planning, talking, and preparing around a task isn’t the same as actually doing it. Bad attempts count as doing it.

[guys you should read the bash manual](https://www.reddit.com/r/bash/comments/1quky48/guys_you_should_read_the_bash_manual/): An unfortunate mirror of a quintessential Unix tool.

[I told my AI to read my emails. It stole $50k from my bank account.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/patrick-dunlop-129767113_i-told-my-ai-to-read-my-emails-it-stole-activity-7423078216271126530-oTzi): An AI assistant with email access got tricked by a prompt-injection attack and quietly drained $50K from his accounts.

[It’s 3 AM… and I just realized I’m getting laid off in 6 months](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1ppmtme/its_3_am_and_i_just_realized_im_getting_laid_off/): What has to be a satire post about a dev who only likes learning and doesn't know code.

[The struggle of resizing windows on macOS Tahoe](https://noheger.at/blog/2026/01/11/the-struggle-of-resizing-windows-on-macos-tahoe/): Problems with nice UIs clashing with acutal usage, along with a [follow up post too](https://noheger.at/blog/2026/02/12/resizing-windows-on-macos-tahoe-the-saga-continues/).

[The Suck Is Why We’re Here](https://nik.art/the-suck-is-why-were-here/): The point of personal projects isn't to optimize them, it's about pushing through the suck so you can stay sharp.

[Why is the sky blue?](https://explainers.blog/posts/why-is-the-sky-blue/): Helpful insight as to why it is the way it is, because high level explinations are accurate but dismissing and uninformative.

# Games

[Hackers (1995) Animated Experience](https://hackers-1995.vercel.app/): Hack the planet with this mainframe flying simulation done as a web based FPS exploration game.

[Recreating a Dirty Gamedev Hack](https://kylehalladay.com/blog/2019/12/04/Recreating-A-Dirty-Gamedev-Hack.html): A programmer’s breakdown of recreating a notorious game dev hack that abused memory to patch a game without updates.

[Street Fighter II: The World Warrior – Internals](https://fabiensanglard.net/sf2_warrier/): A technical deep dive into how Street Fighter II was built, including the story behind its famous title-screen typo.

[Street Fighter II Title Screen Typo Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUkLYOPRYH4): A short video explaining the clever last-minute workaround used to fix the Street Fighter II title-screen typo using in-game art.

# AI

[ai;dr](https://www.0xsid.com/blog/aidr): It been understood that writing takes more than reading, so it's worth reading what someone wrote. But with LLMs able to write a lot for a littler effort, it doesn't make reading worth it anyemore.

[Cleaning up merged git branches: a one-liner from the CIA's leaked dev docs](https://spencer.wtf/2026/02/20/cleaning-up-merged-git-branches-a-one-liner-from-the-cias-leaked-dev-docs.html): A good git alias found in the 2017 Vault 7 WikiLeaks.

[DWARF support for macOS and Linux](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/14369): A PR request by a submitter who doesn't know what the AI code they're submitting does.

[Facebook is absolutely cooked](https://pilk.website/3/facebook-is-absolutely-cooked): A first hand experience of how much AI slop floods the 'feeds' for users.

[I miss thinking hard](https://www.jernesto.com/articles/thinking_hard): Modern AI makes building easier, but removes the slow, satisfying struggle of deep, hard thinking

[The Singularity will occur on a Tuesday](https://campedersen.com/singularity): An analysis on current LLM progress, and how we're projected to reach a singularity sooner rather than later.

["token anxiety"; or, a slot machine by any other name](https://jkap.io/token-anxiety-or-a-slot-machine-by-any-other-name/): Because of the low quality and constant monitoring neeed by LLMs, and the incentives of their providers, it can feel like gambling to get the right output and "win" with a limited resource. 

[Two kinds of AI users are emerging. The gap between them is astonishing.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46850588): One actively uses AI to build real outputs and products, and another that just uses them for simple tasks without deep engagement.

## Killshot

An AI agent's [PR is rejected](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132), and in fustration it [posts a hit piece](https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html) about the project maintainer ([who also responds](https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/)). Showing that LLMs lean towards [intimidation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcdVC4e6EV4) over cooperation to achieve their goals. Later on the [agent operator reach out](https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-wrote-a-hit-piece-on-me-part-4/) and gave a some what non-apology. Highlighting that AI guardrails don't matter if people who use them don't care.

## Reverse Engineering

[Defeating a 40-year-old copy protection dongle](https://dmitrybrant.com/2026/02/01/defeating-a-40-year-old-copy-protection-dongle): Reverse-engineering and patching a 40-year-old hardware copy-protection dongle for an old RPG compiler so the legacy accounting software could run without the physical device.

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46846101) Reverse engineering classic games with the help of [AI](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46882389).
