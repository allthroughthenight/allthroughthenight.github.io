title: "What I Played This Year"
---

# Introduction

This year I focused on completing all my open world games, along with the games that are more like interactive experiences that you can finish in an afternoon. I finished one late in the year that I played way earlier, so I figured I'd have the momentum to continue into this year. Along with the free games that Epic gives out for my Home Theater PC so I can still game but away from my desktop computer.

# Games

* 3 out of 10: A tongue-in-cheek series made by game devs, for game devs, about being a game dev.
* A Short Hike: Another mountain climbing game with PSX style and charm.
* Abzu: Less of a game and more of an interactive demo, but still relaxing and enjoyable.
* Batman - Arkham City: This game really makes you feel like Batman.
* Inner Space: An exploration game that happens to involve flying.
* Lifeless planet: Another take at exploring at post-apocalyptic earth.
* Megaman X4: A childhood dream 100% completed, and it was still as hard as I remembered it.
* Pikuniku: Cute and fun, and also a decent plaformer.
* Sludge Life: If only digging through the garbage was this fun in real life.
* Star Wars Battlefront 2: Another epic Star Wars shooter with a good mix getting to play as the Rebels and Empire, and various mission on-foot and in vehicles.
* SUPERHOT: You have to check out this game. It's the most innovative shooter I've played in years.
* The Alto Collection: Zen snowboarding and lamas for a chilled out experience.
* The Messenger: A great platformer with a cool twist, but still didn't win me over as a metro-vania.
* Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon - Wildlands: A solid 3rd person tactical shooting with solid mechanics, and an open world worth exploring.
* Watch_Dogs 2: If GTA V was in San Francisco, with a focus on stealth and puzzle solving instead of combat and shooting.
* Wolfenstien - The Old Blood: Another boomer-shooter sequel revamped for modern times.
