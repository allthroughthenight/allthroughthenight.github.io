title: "What I Played This Year"
---

# Introduction

This year I focused on completing all my open world games. I finished one late in the year that I played way earlier, so I figured I'd have the momentum to continue into this year. Along with the free games that Epic gives out for my Home Theater PC so I can still game but away from my desktop computer.

# Games

* 3 out of 10: A tongue-in-cheek series made by game devs, for game devs, about being a game dev.
* Abzu: Less of a game and more of an interactive demo, but still enjoyable.
* Star Wars Battlefront 2: Another epic Star Wars shooter with a good mix between each faction, with mission on-foot and in vehicles.
* SUPERHOT: You have to check out this game. It's the most innovative shooter I've played in years.
* Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon - Wildlands: A great 3rd person shooter, with solid mechanics and handling, and an open world that can stand on it's own.
