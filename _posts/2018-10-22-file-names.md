File naming conventions are tough. Many try, few succeed. Just like variable naming, it leaves a lot open to [The Bike Shed Effect](http://bikeshed.com). Most default to the ALL_UPPER_AND_UNDERSCORES. Though simple to implement, it's a hassle to type. In my experience, having some kind of lower case really helps, and as shown by the designers of [Jock Kinneir & Margaret Calvert](http://www.britishroadsignproject.co.uk/jock-kinneir-margaret-calvert), having upper and lowercase helps with readability.

Also, organizations suck with standardizing how they want to write the time and date. Most are cultural i.e. day/month/year, year/month/day, etc. The problem with spelling out the month is that it doesn't organize well. And with having month or day first it groups everything wrong. A better way is to have the year/month/day, from largest to biggest. Grouping things by year, then so on and so forth. 

Considering how well this works, there's already a standard for it called [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) and it states that you just simply put year, month, day. And if you want to be more specific, then you can add the time with hour, minute, seconds. This works great because then it organizes from largest to smallest, so you don't have to worry about weird grouping.
