title: "Cooling Down and Fading Faster"
---

[Google's headquarters](https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/tech/google-creators-event.html) was a beacon of innovation and experimentation, where ideas and bold thinking came together to revolutionize the world. Today, they're like a museum piece, a relic of a time when tech was young and full of hope.

Remember when Apple's iPhone was the epitome of cool? Having one made you feel like you were part of the cool kids club? Those days are gone, and now it's just another commodity.

The [hn discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42002262) is filled lament about the loss of innovation and creativity in the industry. We're left with a bunch of homogenized products and services. The excitment is gone, replaced by the humdrum of updates and bug fixes.

The tech hype train that me and my cohort saw when we were in school left without us. Maybe we had a chance, but it'll likely never happen again. I have a friend that left Tesla and left their last RSU. And they've been stressed about the FOMO for not [toughing it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9yTbdsL1aI). Even though our group of friends have told him not to over think it, I feel for him. Sometimes it's hard to have a chance and lose it, than to have never had it at all.

The generational wealth for those who were able to get a decent 'big tech' job in the mid teens during zero interest loans won't happen again in our lifetime. By proxy I've interacted with a few or who're friend's of a friend. Most are now insular 

Thankfully me and my partner are still in a situation where we're finacially secure regardless of the job market, but the same can't be said for all our friends.

The cool factor of tech has faded, replaced by a dull grey of mediocrity.
