title: "Cooling Down and Fading Faster"
---

[Google's headquarters](https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/tech/google-creators-event.html) was a beacon of innovation and experimentation, where ideas and bold thinking came together to revolutionize the world. Today, they're like a museum piece, a relic of a time when tech was young and full of hope.

Remember when Apple's iPhone was the epitome of cool? Having one made you feel like you were part of the cool kids club? Those days are gone, and now it's just another commodity.

The [hn discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42002262) is filled lament about the loss of innovation and creativity in the industry. We're left with a bunch of homogenized products and services. The excitment is gone, replaced by the humdrum of updates and bug fixes.

The cool factor of tech has faded, replaced by a dull grey of mediocrity.
