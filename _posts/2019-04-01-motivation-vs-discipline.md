These past few months have been somewhat of a whirlwind now that I've hit my stride at work, moved into a new place, and finally feel settled. But in the chaos I forgot about being consistent in my self development.

I've always searched my environment for balance, but when things are in flux I can't focus. But life is always in flux, and if I rely on what's out of my control then I'll always be at the whim of things I can't control.

When it come to starting something new, many people like to get fired up, [mentally masturbate](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mental_masturbation), but come the next morning most will say 'I'll start later' and continue with their normal lives.

Some could say that they didn't get motivated, or aren't dedicated enough, but I have a few counters to that.

#### 1. Learn to plan to plan to learn

If all it took to complete a goal was will, than many people would be able to what they wanted to, but it takes more than that. The best way to help with accomplishing something is to have a plan.

From something simple like a grocery list for dinner, or drafting blue prints for a new high rise. There's nothing wrong without an ambitious goal, but without a plan it's just wishful thinking. The more you plan, the less you have to think about doing, and only have to worry about executing.

Know that there's a balance, all planning doesn't make up for no action, and no plan will cover everything. But overall it'll should give you an idea of what to do and the next steps to continue.

#### 2. Consistency

No matter how motivated you are, unless you regularly and consistency do what you need to do, you won't get very far. When first starting a fitness routine, most personal trainers will advocate for many light work-outs over a few intense ones. It's more powerful to create a habit than to try to rush to a result and burn out.

#### 3. Prioritization

Learn to know what's actionable now, what should be done later, and what's not worth it. This is how you can prevent yourself from being overwhelmed. By keeping your mental space clear, it allows you to focus in-depth at a task at hand, and delve deeper to yield better results.

There are many more points I could cover to help with habit building and consistency, but overall these are the major points that helped me through some rough times.
