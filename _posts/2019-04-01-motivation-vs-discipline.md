These past few months have been somewhat of a whirlwind now that I've hit my stride at work, moved into a new place, and finally feel settled after moving halfway across the globe. But in all that chaos, I forgot the most important thing to my self development. Consistency.

I've always searched my environment for balance, but when my life is in chaos I can't focus. But life is always in flux, and if I rely on what's out of my control then I'll always be at the mercy of things I don't always have direct control of.

When it come to starting something new, many people like to get fired up, [mentally masturbate](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mental_masturbation), but come the next morning most will say 'I'll start later' and continue with their normal lives.

Some could say that they didn't get motivated, or aren't dedicated enough. But I have a few counters to that.

#### 1. Learn to plan to plan to learn

If all it took to complete a goal was to will it, than many people would be able to. Unfortunately it takes more that just will. The most basic skill that will help any one with accomplishing anything is to plan what you need to do to get it done.

From something simple as making a grocery list for dinner, or drafting blue prints for a new high rise. There's nothing wrong without an ambitious goal, but without a plan it's just wishful thinking. The more you plan, the less you have to think about doing, and only have to worry about executing.

Know that there's a balance, and all planning doesn't make up for no action. And that no plan will cover everything, but it should give you an idea of what to do and the next step to follow.

#### 2. Consistency

No matter how motivated you are, unless you regularly and consistency do what you need to do, you won't get very far.When first starting a training routine, any personal trainer advocate for many lite work-outs over a few intense ones. It's more powerful to create a habit than to try to rush to a result and burn out.

#### 3. Prioritization

Learn to know what's actionable now, what should be done later, and what's chaff that can be left by the way side. This is how you can't prevent from being overwhelmed. By keeping your mental space clear, it allows you to focus in-depth at a task at hand, and delve deeper to yield better results.

There are many more points I could cover to help with habit building and consistency, but these are the major points that'd helped me through some rough times.
