When people hear about all the data breaches and am ask for advice, the best suggestion I give everyone is to use a [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager).

Password [complexity](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/10/24/do-we-really-need-strong-passwords/) [requirements](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/08/17/why-you-still-cant-trust-password-strength-meters/) aren't very helpful, it's [length](https://xkcd.com/936) and making each site [unique](https://xkcd.com/792/) that works best.

I also recommend [multi-factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication). It's not if, but when you password will be leaked. So having a secondary method to authenticate prevents your security from relying on one piece of data.

For myself, I use [LassPass](https://www.lastpass.com) mostly because it's what worked for me at the time when I was looking for one. And it has a lot of [authentication](https://support.logmeininc.com/lastpass/help/enable-multifactor-authentication-lp010002) methods.

One scenario is that you lose your authentication device i.e your phone. To fix this, you can get one-time recovery codes. LastPass has a cool feature with Grid Authentication that gives you a unique grid, which is then references by column and row. This isn't that much more secure, but it is reusable so if you're ever without your phone for a while you have a way to continue to use multi-factor authentication.
