When I got my first computer for myself, it came with Windows pre-installed. I tinkered with is for a while trying various Linux distros, but since the Windows Product key was on a sticker under the battery, I was always able to reinstall a valid version of Window in case anything happened.

When I started my undergrad I didn't care for Windows, and used Linux as a daily driver. Once I graduated I made myself a desktop and went back to Windows to play games with classmates.

Windows 10 allows you to install it without a product key now, but it limits certain functionalities and has a watermark in the bottom right no matter what you're doing. For a while this didn't bother me till I started using it to stream movies and TV shows and wanted to get rid of it while watching.

Windows 10 keys are expensive and require a Microsoft account which I didn't want to do at all. Instead I went with a certified key seller. At first it seemed a bit sketchy, but reading around a lot of reputable computer makers get their keys from places like these, and sellers have ratings, so if it went wrong I didn't have to worry about losing any money. And the cost difference was very attractive as well, $100 from Microsoft or $20 from a reseller.

The biggest difference is that resellers tell you up front you can only use their keys for new installs, while not connected to the internet, and it has to be done via [phone activation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/product-activation-for-windows-online-support-telephone-numbers-35f6a805-1259-88b4-f5e9-b52cccef91a0). For my first build this seemed a bit involved, but once my motherboard and CPU were registered to the key, I wouldn't have to worry about this activation process ever again.

I upgraded my desktop twice, once for the motherboard, and once for the CPU. Both times I had issues with the hardware registration, but following the proper activation process (offline, new install, phone call) resolved the issue fine. And while troubleshooting some hardware I cloned a Windows 10 install I already had, and this was [detected by Microsoft](https://www.gfisk.com/disk-clone-windows-activation-0xc004c008/) so make sure you're careful about that as well.

When it was time to make myself a whole new desktop PC I forgot about the hardware registration process. I tried the phone activation method a few times but was told that it was already registered to other hardware, when I said that I owned that hardware they said it didn't matter since it was already registered and I'd need to get a new key.

After getting a new key, everything went along as expected and there was no other issues. Talking about it with friends, I had the key for about five years so I think I got my $20 worth and then some. We'll see how this key goes for the next five years as well.
