title: "Quiet Checklist"
---

There is conflicting information going around for how to achieve a goal. On one side, you should announce your goals so others can hold you accountable. On the other side, you shouldn't tell anyone else you're not doing it for yourself.

I've never subscribed to the first train of thought, partly because of the second. If I need to lean on outside support for motivation, then maybe I'm not motivated for the right reasons.

I recently read an [article](https://sivers.org/zipit) that's somewhat confirmed my suspicion, but in a different way. But to summarize the main point, you shouldn't tell others your goals and plans, or even your progress. Since you'll get the same mental reward from just talking about how awesome you want to be, as if you actually did it. So don't talk about it, be about it.

But it's easy to stop talking, what should you start doing? My advice for most people is to make a checklist, and can be reasoned with the quote below:

> "Why do I love checklists? Because, rather than letting my imagination run amok to my detriment, effective use of checklists allows me to direct my imagination to more productive purposes."

So instead of trying to think about a work out to do every time you go to the gym, just look at your checklist and get it done. Then if something isn't right, you've saved the mental capacity to make adjustments, instead of wasting it trying to plan what you wanted to do to begin with.

Overall, just start doing and to hell with everyone else. It's about progress, not perfection.
