As someone who works in tech, when people hear about all the data breaches and ask for advice, the best suggestion I give everyone is to use a [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager).

Password [complexity](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/10/24/do-we-really-need-strong-passwords/) [requirements](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/08/17/why-you-still-cant-trust-password-strength-meters/) aren't very helpful, and it's [length](https://xkcd.com/936) and making sites [unique](https://xkcd.com/792/) which works best.

I also recommend to use [multi-factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication). It's not if, but when you password will be leaked. So by having a secondary way to authenticate you don't have to rely on that one bit of data.

For myself, I use [LassPass](https://www.lastpass.com) mostly because it was the best available at the time when I was looking for. And it has a lot of [authentication](https://support.logmeininc.com/lastpass/help/enable-multifactor-authentication-lp010002) methods.

One of the worst case scenarios that could happen is if you lose your authentication device, which is usually your phone, which could likely happen. To work around this, you can get one-time recovery codes. I don't really like that idea since once they're used then they're done.

LastPass has a cool work around with Grid Authentication which give you a unique grid, which is then references by column and row. This isn't that much more secure, but it is reusable so if you're ever without your phone for a long period of time, you have a way to continue to use multi-factor authentication.
