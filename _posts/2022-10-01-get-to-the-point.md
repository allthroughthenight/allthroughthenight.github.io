Sychonizing a remote team requires some kind of chat app. My company uses Slack, others might use Teams, me and my friends use Discord. Growing up with tech I like to think my messaging skills are pretty good. But when it comes to a work enviornment it's a bit different. 

Early on in my carerr I learned that brevity is best. Avoid explaining every technical detail or minutia to better set the context. It's almost always better to [just ask](https://dontasktoask.com/) (politely, of course) to save everyone's time.

This also means avoid unnessisary interactions. In person you politely get someones attention before saying what you need to. But on messaging apps, they send notifications to get the receivers attention. Again, this doesn't mean start by sending a whole paragraph, but you [don't have to say hello](https://nohello.net/en/) as a separete message either.

Be brief, be brilliant, be gone.
