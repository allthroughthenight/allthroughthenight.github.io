title: "What I Learned This Year"
---

# Introduction

Third year, third post, to follow up on [2019]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/01/01/what-i-learned-this-year.html) and [2020]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/01/01/what-i-learned-this-year.html). I tried restricting my reddit and hacker news reflex with [LecchBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/), then I noticed I'd leave it disabled for days at a time, but it did help break the habit. Also this year I didn't read as many technical write-ups, and instead read more stuff on soft skills. With my new position I'm learning a lot on the job already, so I most of my free reading was about the meta of being in tech.

> “Above all, do not lose your desire to walk. Everyday, I walk myself into a state of well-being & walk away from every illness. I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it. But by sitting still, & the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill. Thus if one just keeps on walking, everything will be all right.”

1. Locate the portion of code most relevant to the immediate task at hand.
2. Understand that code enough to form a hypothesis about the change you need to make.
3. Make that change and test your hypothesis. Sometimes the best way will be to click around in the UI or run a particular script. Sometimes the easiest path is to write a test that describes the behavior you're after.
4. If your hypothesis was incorrect, return to step 2. Understand why that change didn't do what you thought it would, and develop a new hypothesis.
5. Once you have working code, improve its quality. Write a test (or a few) that document the changes in behavior you made. Refactor your code for clarity and style.
