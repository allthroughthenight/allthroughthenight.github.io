# Introduction

Third year, third post, to follow up on [2019]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/01/01/what-i-learned-this-year.html) and [2020]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/01/01/what-i-learned-this-year.html). I tried restricting my reddit and hacker news reflex with [LecchBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/), then I noticed I'd leave it disabled for days at a time, but it did help break the habit. Also this year I didn't read as many technical write-ups, and instead read more stuff on soft skills. With my new position I'm learning a lot on the job already, so I most of my free reading was about the meta of being in tech.

[Don’t Underestimate the Power of a Walk](https://hbr.org/2021/02/dont-underestimate-the-power-of-a-walk)
> “Above all, do not lose your desire to walk. Everyday, I walk myself into a state of well-being & walk away from every illness. I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it. But by sitting still, & the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill. Thus if one just keeps on walking, everything will be all right.”

[new codebase, who dis? (How to Join a Team and Learn a Codebase)](https://www.samueltaylor.org/articles/how-to-learn-a-codebase.html):
1. Locate the portion of code most relevant to the immediate task at hand.
2. Understand that code enough to form a hypothesis about the change you need to make.
3. Make that change and test your hypothesis. Sometimes the best way will be to click around in the UI or run a particular script. Sometimes the easiest path is to write a test that describes the behavior you're after.
4. If your hypothesis was incorrect, return to step 2. Understand why that change didn't do what you thought it would, and develop a new hypothesis.
5. Once you have working code, improve its quality. Write a test (or a few) that document the changes in behavior you made. Refactor your code for clarity and style.

[on: Maximizing Developer Effectiveness](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25800830):
> Here I am, a productive developer eager to deliver maximum value to my customers and apply my innovation to company goals.
> Open up JIRA and pick up a unit of work to produce today -- gotta stay faithful to those story points!
> Somehow, a magic team of spherical devops in a vacuum created an environment where things are just green, predictable, and are never broken.
> Another theoretical team of angels from a parallel universe has materialized into this one, updated all the docs, and beamed back into their universe of productivity and effectiveness.
> Unit of work defined, I then proceed to produce it for a few hours completely uninterrupted, since if another human being were to make contact, I'd simply explode and format my hard drive, losing all my productivity.
> It's break time -- I ingest 2 story points of coffee and join a game of table tennis. The ball bounces back and forth without ever touching the ground. My movements are productive, and value-adding, just like my partner's.
> Back to producing units of work, only half a story point left (sike! no such thing as half a story point, and no such thing as "left", as it's a measure of effort, not time. Almost got you there!).
> Git push! Automatic CI gains consciousness and validates that my work unit has no chance of causing a user to break our software. It gives me a thumbs up and discards its human shell to fade back into the ones and zeros. A QA engineer cries out in the distance.
> A metric of my productivity is logged to the OKR database.
> Nothing breaks, and nothing unexpected happens, as the universe is completely predictable. 

[on: The computers rejecting job applications](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26065594):
> The next logical step would be to train an adversarial AI against the hiring AI. You'd have the system generate your resume and application to maximize your chances. Then the hiring AI would need to be re-trained to account for this. And so on.
> In the far future, this feedback loop creates an economy where every job application is total gibberish. No human can possibly explain why their resume is a recipe for carne asada, an excerpt from Moby Dick, and a bunch of windings. But supposedly it's predicted to increase final offer salary by 13.54%, so nobody questions it. Anybody who still writes out their resume by hand is considered a luddite weirdo, and definitely not someone you'd want to have join your company.
