# Introduction

Following up on my [previous post]({{site.baseurl}}/2020-08-01-my-set-up.html), this one is to highlight the changes I made to improve my WFH experience.

# Keyboard

Previously I had a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000. I'd always been eyeing one for a while, but usual MSRP was about $50 on the low end. Then one day while bumping around Best Buy with a classmate I found one for $20 on sale so I bought it on the spot. It served me well for a few years, the ergonomic design definetly helped with some strain issues I was having, but it wasn't perfect. It's size made it clunky, the space bar felt wobbly, and the overall build quality wasn't that great.

The next step was a [split mechanical keyboard](https://github.com/diimdeep/awesome-split-keyboards), but looking around most manufactured models cost a premium (e.g. [ErgoDox](https://ergodox-ez.com/), [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/)). Looking around more, the [Iris keyboard](https://keeb.io/collections/iris-split-ergonomic-keyboard) is one of the few left that are still in production and readily available. My current [Ducky One 2 Mini](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One2-Mini-Pure-White-RGB) Cherry MX Blues, but looking for "quiet clickey switches" means "tractile switches" which means "Glorious Holy Pandas". As for the keykaps, I went with a cheap ortholinear set I found on Amazon. 

My future plans for my Iris aren't ambitious, just want to be able to tent it and get some nicer keycaps. My real end goal is a [Dactyl Manuform](https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform), but I'd like to first get comfortable with a split and ortholiear keyboard before I jump into one that's also parameterized and concaved.

# Desk

Overall the same as my previous post, but I've cleared up some desk space by mounting my speakers underneath and done some real cable management since I have a curious cat always roaming around.
