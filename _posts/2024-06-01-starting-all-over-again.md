title: "Starting All Over Again"
---

I was laid off late last year. Due to seasonal work I was employed during the winter and spring, but now that it's summer I'm looking for work. I made my [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7127389015367925760/), talked with friends and coworkers, and now I'm seriously searching.

This [hn post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34161822) and [it's article](https://www.stevenbuccini.com/8-hard-truths-on-getting-laid-off) have echoed some similar truths.

Now that I've been working for a while, recruiters have reached out more and been more communicative. The biggest mental block for me is being back 'out in the open' and having to prep for technical interviews again. I've always been okay at them, but my impression is that the bar has been raised since I last searched.

Finacially me and my partner aren't worried about any regular expensises or minor emergencies. I would say we're worried about major emergencies, but I think everyone is.

For anyone else that's back 'out in the open' again I wish you the best out there.
