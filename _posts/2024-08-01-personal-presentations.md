While in university during my undergrad, I was the vice president of the student cyber security club. Between competitions and finals we had a lot of downtime during our bi-weekly meetings to fill. I felt that if people are making the time to come to something, you should make it worth it for them. Having been apart of organizations with apathetic leadership was always fustrating. So I made sure we had something productive to talk about or do or listen to at meetings. I also I made sure I had some time in front of everyone so they could listen to me speak, and so I'd get experience in front of others also. Digging around, I was able to come up with the past presentation I created.

[You, Me, and the Magic Smoke](/assets/2024-08-01-personal-presentations/you-me-and-the-magic-smoke.pdf): Due to training from other work, I'm proficient at reading and troubleshooing electronic block and wiring diagrams. Looking back, this presentation wasn't about being informative, and me just geeking out. I distintly remember some two folks in the audience who were actual electrical engineers and familiar with the concepts telling me "You laid out and presenting everything well, but it's a lot for the average person to take in at once".

[Secretly Surf Cyber-space](/assets/2024-08-01-personal-presentations/secretly-surf-cyberspace.pdf): A high level overview of the internet and how to anonymously use it. I would say half the audience was just familiar with the concepts, one quarts had tried them, and the last quarter had never heard of any of this at all.

[You and I and Command Line](/assets/2024-08-01-personal-presentations/you-i-and-the-command-line.pdf): During undergrade I had a basic X201 Thinkpad as my daily driver. It was durable and portable, but too under powered to run Windows. Instead I went cold turkey with Ubuntu, along with getting familiar with the command line. This presentation doesn't have anything revolutionary, but during meetings a lot of people would ask about my computer set-up and how I used it. So this presentation was a way to walk through it while explaining why I did what I did.

[Lock It Up](/assets/2024-08-01-personal-presentations/lock-it-up.pdf): During my undergrad physical security was starting to overlap with cybersecurity. Hackers understood that just like software, hardware secuirty manufatuers were taking shortcuts that could be exploited in trivial ways. One issue I remember when giving this presentation is that the lock picking pictures should've been animated. So mid-presentation when I saw them frozen (after waiting an awkward time for them to animate) I instead went to the end of the presentation where I linked the [source site](https://www.art-of-lockpicking.com/how-to-pick-a-lock-guide/).

These presentation aren't anything to brag about. It's just interesting to look back and reminice. Hopefully by sharing these I've learned a bit more about who I was, how I've improved, and how I can change going forward.
