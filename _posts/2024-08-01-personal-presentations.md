During my undergrad, I was the vice president of the student cyber security club and helped organize our bi-weekly meetings. Having been apart of organizations with apathetic leadership always fustrated me. So I made sure we had something to do at meetings. I also made sure I had some time in front of everyone so they could listen to me speak, and so I'd get experience in front of others. Digging around, I found the past presentation I created.

[You, Me, and the Magic Smoke](/assets/2024-08-01-personal-presentations/you-me-and-the-magic-smoke.pdf): Due to training from other work, I'm proficient at reading and troubleshooing electronic block and wiring diagrams. Looking back, this presentation wasn't informative and me just geeking out. I distintly remember some two folks in the audience who were actual electrical engineers telling me "You presented everything well, but it's too much for anyone to learn at once".

[Secretly Surf Cyber-space](/assets/2024-08-01-personal-presentations/secretly-surf-cyberspace.pdf): An overview of the internet and how to anonymously use it. About 1/4 of the audience had tried these methods, 1/2 the audience was familiar with the concepts, and the last 1/4 didn't know any of this.

[You and I and Command Line](/assets/2024-08-01-personal-presentations/you-i-and-the-command-line.pdf): During my undergrad I had a X201 Thinkpad as my daily driver. It was durable and portable, but too under powered to run Windows. I went cold turkey with Ubuntu, along with getting familiar with the command line. When classmates would look over my shoulder they'd my set-up and how I used it, so this presentation was to talk through it and why I did what I did.

[Lock It Up](/assets/2024-08-01-personal-presentations/lock-it-up.pdf): During my undergrad, the appeal of physical security as part of the cybersecurity zeitgeist was [taking off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHf1vD5_b5I). Hackers understood that just like software, hardware secuirty manufatuers took shortcuts that could be exploited in trivial ways. One issue I remember when giving this presentation is that the lock picking pictures should've been animated. So when they froze mid-presentation  (and after waiting an awkward time for them to animate) I went to the end of the presentation where I linked the [source site](https://www.art-of-lockpicking.com/how-to-pick-a-lock-guide/) and we watched those instead.

These presentation aren't anything to brag about. It's just interesting to look back and reminice. And reading these I learned a bit more about who I was, how I've improved, and how I can change going forward.
