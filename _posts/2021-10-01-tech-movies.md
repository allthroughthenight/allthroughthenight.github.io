# Introduction

I'm not one to "drink the Kool-Aid" and think working in tech is something special. It's just a job to pay the bills to get by. But there is a lot of movies out there that can make me a bit proud working in the same field that others find inspiring. So when ever I'm feeling a bit jaded about the industry, these are my go to movies to get energized.
