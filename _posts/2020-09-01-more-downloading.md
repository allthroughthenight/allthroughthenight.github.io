title: "More Downloading"
---

As a follow-up to my previous posts ([Like Scrap]({{site.baseurl}}/2018/07/19/like-scrap.html), and [Auto Download]({{site.baseurl}}/2018/10/08/auto-download.html)), my overall YouTube downloading ability has improved dramatically.
In short, I use a config file now.
The GitHub repo has a [simple overview](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#configuration), so overall if you already know the flags for the options you want, you just place them in `~/.config/youtube-dl/config`.
I don't know why I never thought of this before, and thinking about it now it sounds so simple.
I'm just glad I don't have to spend my time configuring a 150+ character length command, and instead can just manage it like a dotfile.
