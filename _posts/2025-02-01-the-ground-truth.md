Having applied to ~500 listings over the past 18 months, and checking LinkedIn regularly for recruiter messages, there is still a disconnect between the candidates and hiring managers. Here's a summary of the hiring procress:

- HM needs a position filled
- HM asks HR to open a req for the position
- Qualifications and compensation are decided upon
- HR posts the position
- Candidats apply
- ATS recommends X number of the best candidates
- HR reviews the recommendations and forwards them to the HM
- HM selects the candidates they want to interview
- HR schedules the interview and start their interview loops

The ATS filter is the biggest blocker, then HR forwarding candiates to the HM. Here are actionable tips that help improve your chances:

- Automation is king: Use autofill, or any other tools, to apply faster.
- Don't tailor your resume: You can't beat the HR selection lottery, you're better off being the first to apply.
- Numbers don't matter: Don't get discouraged. Cold applying numbers don't matter when some listing get 500+ applications in the first hour.
- Use an email filter: With all the applications being put out, have filters to label them so you can best see them when they arrive.
- Anonymous contact information: Many job sites will have psudo job postings to collect information, use a separate job application email and Google voice number to avoid getting spammed.
- LinkedIn: Have it up to date and check it regularly.

The tone of this post is a bit pessimistic, but when it comes to making a living, you need to be best equiped to take on the challenges of the new job market.
