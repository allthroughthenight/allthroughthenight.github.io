Like my [previous job search post](https://allthroughthenight.github.io/2021/03/01/my-interviewing-success.html), I kept track during this job search, along with another sankey diagram.

Some major differences I made this time around
* Only apply directly: Previously I'd apply to jobs thru job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed) which is a step removed from the actual posting by the company. 
site:lever.co | site:greenhouse.io | site:level.co | site:dover.com "site reliability engineer"
Tools > Time > Past 24 hours
* Using your network: LinkedIn “we’re hiring”
* Use form autofill: I used [Autofill Smartly - JobFill](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/autofill-smartly-jobfill/kbgfilncepjeoodogmebahnloidgaibg?hl=en-US)
