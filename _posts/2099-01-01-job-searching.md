title: "Job Searching"

Like my [previous job search post](https://allthroughthenight.github.io/2021/03/01/my-interviewing-success.html), I did my best to keep track during the job search for another sankey diagram.

return to office some movement
interest rate changes
no longer 18 offers: https://www.18offers.com/

Amazon networking event: lots of talent, few hiring
sphinx: Recruiters asking technical questions, almost like trivia, no ones fault tho
tiktok: cool down
anduril: recruiter and coding went well, but went on cool down (recruiters looked at profile since i'm right in the space)
Spacex: just under prpared overall

meta: missed connection first time around, second time felt good
troubleshooting was straight forward with a build pipeline, along with improvments to prevent human error and better automate, along with monitoring
coding: 1st was almost trivial i.e. string manipulation, second was more about classes, but i missed it thinking it was about a hashset

Some major differences I made this time around
* Only apply directly: Previously I'd apply to jobs thru job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, Dice) but this would be various degrees removed from the actual hiring manager. Where as applying directly on the job site would be sent directly to HR.

* Using your network: LinkedIn “we’re hiring”
* LinkedIn Premium: Doing cold messages can work, but the days of being courted by talent aquisition specialists is over.
* Use form autofill: I used [Autofill Smartly - JobFill](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/autofill-smartly-jobfill/kbgfilncepjeoodogmebahnloidgaibg?hl=en-US)

From 2022-01-01-what-i-learned-this-year.md
[on: The computers rejecting job applications](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26065594):
> The next logical step would be to train an adversarial AI against the hiring AI. You'd have the system generate your resume and application to maximize your chances. Then the hiring AI would need to be re-trained to account for this. And so on.
> In the far future, this feedback loop creates an economy where every job application is total gibberish. No human can possibly explain why their resume is a recipe for carne asada, an excerpt from Moby Dick, and a bunch of windings. But supposedly it's predicted to increase final offer salary by 13.54%, so nobody questions it. Anybody who still writes out their resume by hand is considered a luddite weirdo, and definitely not someone you'd want to have join your company.
