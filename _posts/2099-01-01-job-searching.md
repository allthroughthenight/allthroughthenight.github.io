Like my [previous job search post](https://allthroughthenight.github.io/2021/03/01/my-interviewing-success.html), I kept track during this job search, along with another sankey diagram.

Some major differences I made this time around
* Only apply directly: Previously I'd apply to jobs thru job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, Dice) but this would be various degrees removed from the actual hiring manager. Where as applying directly on the job site would be sent directly to HR.

Tools > Time > Past 24 hours
* Using your network: LinkedIn “we’re hiring”
* LinkedIn Premium: Doing cold messages can work, but the days of being courted by talent aquisition specialists is over.
* Use form autofill: I used [Autofill Smartly - JobFill](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/autofill-smartly-jobfill/kbgfilncepjeoodogmebahnloidgaibg?hl=en-US)

From 2022-01-01-what-i-learned-this-year.md
[on: The computers rejecting job applications](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26065594):
> The next logical step would be to train an adversarial AI against the hiring AI. You'd have the system generate your resume and application to maximize your chances. Then the hiring AI would need to be re-trained to account for this. And so on.
> In the far future, this feedback loop creates an economy where every job application is total gibberish. No human can possibly explain why their resume is a recipe for carne asada, an excerpt from Moby Dick, and a bunch of windings. But supposedly it's predicted to increase final offer salary by 13.54%, so nobody questions it. Anybody who still writes out their resume by hand is considered a luddite weirdo, and definitely not someone you'd want to have join your company.
