In case you haven't noticed, I've been going back to edit and tweak past posts. I'm not trying to rewrite history, but they read so terribly that the posts are almost useless. There is a point to be made that you should keep your past work up to show how you've grown. But I also like going back to read through stuff to reference things I've written about. And if I can't easily read what I've wrote then I can't reference anything.

I'd say it's safe to assume that I have little to no readership of this blog, which is totally fine, so I think I'm okay to edit my past posts so they can at least make grammatical sense. With the way that Jekyll and Github Pages is set up, I can set posts for future dates, but they won't be published until the date arrives. I'd hope that they post would be ready by then, but at least by having them ready to go, it'll prevent me from getting backed up with a backlog, and continually revise and revise the to-be published posts to ensure they're ready.

So as a warning, don't be surprised if you see a new post, but it's not baked at all.
