In case you haven't noticed, I've been going back to edit and tweak past posts. I'm not trying to rewrite history, but they read so terribly that the posts are almost useless. There is a point to be made that you should keep your past work as it is so you can see how you've changes. But I also want to be able to go back and reference things, and if I can't easily read what I've wrote then it's not possible. I'd say it's safe to assume that I have no readership, which is fine, so I think it's okay to edit past posts so they can at least make grammatical sense. 

Also, with the way that Jekyll and Github Pages is set up, I can set posts for future dates, but they won't be published until the date arrives. I'd like the posts to be ready by their set dates, but I'd rather have them be published in rough draft state to prevent me from building up a backlog.

So don't be surprised if you see a new post but it's not complete, yet.
