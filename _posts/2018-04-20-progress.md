It's officially day 10 of my self imposed '30 Days of Code' challenge, and so far it's not going how I expected, but I'm glad with the progress I've made.

Being ~~unemployed~~ a recent graduate, I have a lot of free time. With my previous experience, I've been studying for CompTIA Network+ with the plan to take the test before the end of May. So when it comes to the daily coding challenges it's almost an afterthought and some of the ones I've completed are fairly weak. But it's consistency that I want, and that's what I'm concentrating on.

As for the technical interview situation, I flopped another online coding challenge. This one had 5 long questions but gave 7 days to complete them. I don't think they expect some one to complete it in one sitting, and I didn't plant to either. After receiving the invitation email and registering, I wnet over the problems, bookmarked the site, and went back to what I was doing so I could let the problems mentally soak.

Some time later that day I went back to the challenge, but was told I was already logged in. So I logged out, logged back in, but when I tried opening the challenge it said I was already taking it. Not panicking yet, I knew had the link from the invitation email. I went to my inbox, but due to my clean work I had already deleted it.

At least this failure wasn't from my lack of skills, just my lack of competency.
