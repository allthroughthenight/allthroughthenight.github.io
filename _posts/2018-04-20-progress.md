It's day 10 of my '30 Days of Code' challenge, and so far it's not going how I expected, but I like the progress I've made.

Being a recent graduate, I have a lot of free time. With my previous experience, I've been studying for CompTIA Network+ to take it in a few months. So when it comes to the daily coding challenges it's almost an afterthought and some aren't that hard. But it's consistency that I want, and that's what I'm concentrating on.

As for technical interviews, I flopped another online coding challenge. This one had 5 long questions but gave 7 days to complete them. I don't think they expect some one to complete it in one sitting, and I didn't plant to either. After receiving the invitation email and registering, I went over the problems, bookmarked the site, and went back to what I was doing so I could let them mentally soak.

Some time later that day I went back to the challenges, but was told I was already logged in, so I logged out and logged back in. When I tried opening the challenge again it said I was already taking it. I went to my email inbox to re-use the invite link, but I just clearn my inbox and trash so it was gone forever.

At least this failure wasn't from my lack of skills or preparedness, just my lack of awareness.
