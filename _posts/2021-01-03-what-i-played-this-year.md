title: "What I Played This Year - 2020"
---

Gaming isn't unique to tech, but I've gotten better at working on my backlog, and this year was the year of platformers.

# Games

* Celeste: A simple platformer with mechanics that keep on giving.
* Cuphead: An ode to early animation, with a matching soundtrack, and tough levels.
* Doom Eternal: Fast paced and action packed, and any down time is spent on confirming how bad-ass the game is.
* Halo - The Master Chief Collection: I was raised on Halo 2, so it was nice to play through all the Campings as my 12 year old self always wanted.
* Left 4 Dead: Another game that was around when I was younger, but I never played in it's entirety, and still as scary as I remember.
* Middle Earth - Shadow of War: Using Assassins Creed type of combat, but with a Lord of the Rings spin, along with world effect mechanics made playing side-quests fun.
* Super Meat Boy: A punishing platformer with infinite lives that rewards speed and execution.
* Sonic Mania: It has the same aesthetic and nostalgia as the original Sega Genesis games, with a modern polish and quality of life improvements.
* Speed Runners: A couch co-op game with a tacked on, but still fun single-player story.
* Wolfenstein - The New Order: A boomer shooter that but ends up being a bit of a slog.
