title: "How I Plan"
---

During middle school we were given, and required to carry, around a daily planner, which continued into high school. I didn't use the one they gave us much, instead I'd just make a TO-DO list in my main notepad and work from there. If I finished a task I'd cross it off, if not I'd move it to the next page, and also keep due dates next to some if needed. Later on in high school my parents gave me a combo cork board dry erase calendar. Then I'd put marks on the calendar for events, and maybe have certain TOD

This continued into junior college when I started using G-Suite apps more. Between Keep and Calendar I was able to organize most anything that I had coming up.
