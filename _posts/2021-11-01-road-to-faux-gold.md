During my college undergrad, I made a LinkedIn profile so I could have a larger digital presence and have another link on my resume. Part of that included adding anyone to grow my network end up in more search results.

Within one sitting I was told I couldn't have more than a certain number of pending connection requests. A pop-up then said if upgraded my membership I could send as many as I wanted. I didn't notice any hard blockers from their membership till now. I decided against it since I didn't see any return from having a profile yet.

I canceled some pending request, and only added people I knew. After a while I stopped adding people and started receiving messages from recruiters about opportunities. I'd craft a genuine response, they'd ask for a resume or call. Then it wouldn't lead anywhere and say something like "let's stay in touch" or ghost me entirely. 

It made me a bit frustrated that these people were using my free time to pad their working day. But putting these two ideas together (more connections means more cold-messages, recruiters are paid to reach out) I came up with a simple method to grow my network and make sure I had a pool of contacts to reach out to incase fell on hard times.

Firstly, I gave up on adding random people I didn't know. My guess is that either most don't check LinkedIn enough, or they're filtered since I'm not in their network. Secondly, don't waste time with a nice reply and just use a canned responses. It can be best summarized with the following:
* Recruiter: Hey I have a positions
* Me: Sounds good, let's connect
* Recruiter: Great, please click here or send me your resume
* Me: 

I feel guilty ignoring people trying to do their jobs, but they're compensated for their time while I'm not. The phrase "Your network is your net worth" is somewhat true. And while I don't think LinkedIn is a great way to get a job, it's a strong been a tool I've used that's helped me progress my career.
