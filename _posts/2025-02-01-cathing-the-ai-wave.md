title: "Catching The AI Wave"
---

Last year I attended [GitHub Universe 2024](https://www.githubuniverse.com) virtually. The biggest thing that stood out to me was how much they were pushing Copilot and VS Code's AI integrations towards their goal of [1 billions developers](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/road-1-billion-developers-demetris-cheatham-lh1ff/). The genie is out of the bottle, and to be a professional engineer going forward you need to know how to leverage AI technology for your every day work.

LLMs are resource heavy, so you either need to pay for the services or have good hardward. For myself, I'm somewhat cheap, and I always have the dream of a home lab, so  I decided to put my quality hardware (AMD Ryzen 7 5700G, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TI, 32GB RAM) to use.
